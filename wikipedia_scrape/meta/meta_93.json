She was the first female ruler of the Kingdom of Jerusalem and the first woman to hold a public office in the crusader kingdom. She was already legendary in her lifetime for her generous support of the various Christian communities in her kingdom. Contemporary chronicler William of Tyre praised her wisdom and abilities, while modern historians differ in their assessment."

In the late 1120s, when it became clear that her father would likely not have a son, she was declared heir presumptive to the throne and married Fulk of Anjou. Baldwin II died on 21 August 1131, having conferred the kingdom on Melisende, Fulk, and their son Baldwin III. Melisende and Fulk were crowned on 14 September."

      "content": "Early in their joint reign, King Fulk attempted to rule without Melisende. Barons led by Queen Melisende's kinsman Count Hugh II of Jaffa revolted, and although Hugh was defeated and exiled, Melisende grew powerful and terrorized the king and his supporters until he agreed to accord a share of the government to her. Once reconciled, they had another son, Amalric, and Fulk no longer made any decision in the kingdom without Melisende's assent. During their joint rule, Melisende managed Church relations and patronage. Fulk died on 10 November 1143, and Melisende assumed full power. On 25 December, she was crowned together with their elder son, Baldwin III, who was still underage. Baldwin reached the age of majority in 1145, but Melisende refused to cede any authority to him. After the fall of Edessa in 1144, Melisende urged a military intervention from Europe, but likely opposed the Second Crusade's eventual focus–the failed attempt to conquer Damascus in 1148."

In early April 1152 it was decided in the High Court that the kingdom would be divided between mother and son. Within weeks, however, Baldwin invaded Melisende's portion and besieged her in the Tower of David. In late April Melisende agreed to step down and retire to Nablus. She continued to involve herself in the affairs of her family, who also ruled the crusader states of Antioch and Tripoli. Although her influence in Jerusalem became limited, she counseled Baldwin and took a successful military initiative in his absence. Her patronage and involvement in ecclesiastical matters also continued. In 1161 she became incapacitated by an illness, possibly a stroke, and died on 11 September."

During this journey the king of Jerusalem, Baldwin I, died. Baldwin II was elected to succeed him.[8] In 1119 the new king returned to Edessa to install his cousin Joscelin of Courtenay as the new count and to bring his wife and their daughters to Jerusalem.[9] Melisende's youngest sister, Ioveta, was born after her parents were crowned king and queen in 1119.[10]"

This militarized model of kingship made female rule particularly problematic, as it clashed with entrenched expectations of a warrior-king.[15]"

The delay may reflect her father's lingering hope of producing a son; until then, Melisende remained a potential successor, and the king likely hesitated to settle for a match unworthy of that status, just as appropriate suitors may have been wary of her uncertain future.[6] Queen Morphia died probably in 1126 or 1127. Because he no longer expected to have a son, King Baldwin started providing for his daughters and settling his succession.[11] Melisende, the eldest daughter, was to be his heir. Alice, the second eldest, was married to Prince Bohemond II of Antioch in 1126. Hodierna, the third daughter, may have already been betrothed to Raymond of Tripoli at this time. Ioveta, the youngest, was sent to the Convent of Saint Anne; the historian Hans E. Mayer believes that this was \"the safest way\" to ensure that her status as a porphyrogenita (born to crowned parents) would not threaten Melisende's claim.[20]"

After conferring with King Louis VI, the embassy arrived in early 1128 at the court of Count Fulk V of Anjou.[20] The historian Steven Runciman holds that Fulk was selected by Louis.[21] Mayer asserts that Fulk was chosen by an assembly held in the Kingdom of Jerusalem before the embassy departed, citing William of Tyre, and that the embassy only sought Louis's consent, which was necessary because Fulk was Louis's vassal.[20] Fulk was considerably older than Melisende and already an experienced ruler.[22] He had been to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage in 1120 and left a good impression by personally providing for a force of 100 knights for a year.[23] His wife, Eremburga of Maine, had died in late 1126,[23] and he already had grown children.[24]"

Melisende did successfully intercede with Fulk not to interfere with Alice's actions.

Hodierna married the count of Tripoli, Raymond II, sometime before 1138. Barber believes that the union was arranged by Melisende in an attempt to link the ruling houses of all the crusader states. Ioveta, who had grown up in a convent, took vows as a nun around 1134.[59] According to William's chronicle, Melisende judged that Ioveta was of too high birth to be a mere nun and decided that she should be made an abbess instead.[52] Barber notes that \"there is no way of knowing\" whether Ioveta wished to live a monastic life or if Melisende induced her to negate the political threat which Ioveta may have represented as the sister born during their father's kingship.[59]"

The Convent of Saint Lazarus, as it came to be known, was in construction for six years. Melisende so generously endowed the convent with estates, golden and silver sacred vessels with precious stones, silks, and ecclesiastical robes that she made it richer than any other monastery or church in the kingdom.[65] Initially Melisende installed an elderly abbess. When the abbess died, Ioveta succeeded as Melisende intended, and Melisende sent further gifts, namely books, ornaments, and chalices.[56] In the construction and endowment of Bethany's convent Hamilton sees a \"spectacular\" example of Melisende's power of patronage.[52]"

The king was not amenable to the Syriacs' plight, but agreed to delay judgement until the case was heard in the queen's presence. Thanks to Melisende's intercession, the Syriacs kept their land.[77] She worked to improve relations with the Armenian Church as well; its leader, the catholicos Gregory III, attended a synod of the Latin Church in Jerusalem in 1140.

The monk wrote that the queen did this to ensure that Alfonso Jordan, a relative of the counts of Tripoli, would not threaten the possession of Tripoli by her brother-in-law Raymond and sister Hodierna.[92] Melisende was on good terms with the Premonstratensians, however, and Barber attributes the monk's hostility to the \"endemic misogyny of the monastic world\".[91]"

Barber holds that Fulcher must have risen to the patriarchate with Melisende's support, yet he led the opposition to her choice of Ralph.[76] The conflict over the see of Tyre marked the only time Melisende was at odds with the Church.[78]"

In any case, the army did not reach Edessa in time:[97] the city fell to the Turks, who spared its Armenian and Greek population, but \"killed the Franks wherever they could\" according to the chronicler Michael the Syrian.[96] When word of Edessa's fall reached Jerusalem, Melisende sent to Antioch to consult with its leaders about dispatching an embassy to the pope to request a new crusade.[99] Baldwin III came of age on his fifteenth birthday in early 1145,[81] but the occasion was not publicly celebrated.[80]"

He came to Jerusalem and offered to deliver his towns to the Franks if they would establish him as lord in the Hauran. Melisende convened her council to consider the proposal. Though Damascus was their ally, the offer was appealing: the Hauran had a largely Christian population, and control of the region would place Damascus in a vulnerable position.[101] Unur's army prevented Altuntash from returning to either Bosra or Salkhad.[102] The Franks assembled an army at Tiberias, but also informed Unur that they intended to reinstall Altuntash. Unur objected, citing the queen's own feudal law against supporting rebellious vassals of friendly powers. He offered to repay her costs. Melisende sent a knight, Bernard Vacher, to inform Damascus that her army would escort Altuntash back to Bosra but would not attack Damascene territory. Bernard was persuaded by Unur that the expedition should be dropped. He convinced the young King Baldwin, and the council decided to abandon the plan. Agitators in the army, angered by the loss of a potentially profitable campaign, demanded that the expedition go forward. Baldwin gave in, only to be soundly defeated after Unur allied with Zengi's successor Nur al-Din.[103] Mayer is certain that Melisende blamed Baldwin for the failure to take the Hauran, saying that it may explain how Melisende was able to reduce Baldwin's position by associating her younger son, Amalric, in a subsequent charter.[104]"
