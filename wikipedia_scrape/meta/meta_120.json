He finished the season with 25 wickets in six matches, and took another 20 the following season. His second season involved a display of reverse swing against Maharashtra at Nehru Stadium in Pune, taking 7/93 to dismiss the home team for 311 in response to a Karnataka total of 638 on a good batting pitch.[citation needed]"

He was selected for the Indian team for its 1991–92 tour of Australia, making his test debut against Australia at Brisbane. He took 3/59 as the third fast bowler during the match and finished the tour with ten wickets at 55.30. With an opportunity to take the new ball against South Africa in Cape Town, he took an economical 4/33 in 27 overs and ended the tour with 12 wickets at 26.08. Because the wickets in India were conducive to spin, however, Srinath spent seven consecutive home Test matches watching from the sidelines as India fielded only two fast bowlers."

In the 1997–98 Test series against Australia, one of Srinath's deliveries was measured at 149.6 kilometres per hour (93.0 mph)[9] and Zimbabwe captain Alistair Campbell considered him faster than Lance Klusener and Allan Donald at their peak. He and Grant Flower had also faced Waqar Younis and Wasim Akram.[10] Srinath was India's only regular fast bowler for many years, and his workload is believed to have caused his injuries; he underwent surgery on his right shoulder in 1997.[11]"

At the time, he had 92 test wickets in 27 tests—46 in his first 18, and 46 in his last nine matches.[12] There were some doubts about whether he would be able to play again and when he announced his retirement in November 2003, Srinath said that he thought his career was over when he was recovering from the rotator-cuff injury.[13][12]"

Srinath is a familiar face to cricket viewers around the world as a commentator and ICC match referee.[citation needed] In 2010, he and former teammate Anil Kumble contested the Karnataka State Cricket Association elections. They won and Srinath, as secretary of the association, promotes young cricketers in Karnataka.[citation needed]"
