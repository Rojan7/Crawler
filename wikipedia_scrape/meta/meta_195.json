However upon his return, he lost his previous touch and could not perform as he did before. He was criticized for the loss of form which led to his retirement from cricket soon. \"I retired because I felt unwanted\", he said.[14] At the time he left cricket he was a computer engineer by profession.[15] During his career, he was an elegant batsman and played particularly well on the off side, his trademark flick being a sure shot feature in almost all of his innings.[16] He led the funeral prayers for his former teammate Wasim Akram's spouse, Huma Akram, in Lahore.[17]"

He is the seventh-highest run scorer for Pakistan in Test cricket, and scored 11 centuries and 25 half-centuries during his international career.[4] As an aggressive opening batsman, most of his centuries turned into relatively big scores.[19][20] He scored many of his centuries away against almost every team he toured, and averaged more than 40 against three of the four nations – South Africa, Australia, New Zealand and England – which have been most difficult for Asian batsmen. He has the highest Test batting average (59.06) of any Pakistani against Australia, and once scored two consecutive centuries against them.[21] Former Pakistan captain Ramiz Raja commented the \"[Anwar] used an eclectic approach to batting – classical betrothed to unorthodox, footwork against spin as quick as a hiccup supple yet powerful to brush the field like a Picasso.\"[22]"
