      "content": "Tages were a Swedish rock band from Gothenburg formed in 1963 by vocalist Tommy Blom, rhythm guitarist Danne Larsson, lead guitarist Anders Töpel, bass guitarist Göran Lagerberg and drummer Freddie Skantze.[1] During their seven year tenure, they released six studio albums, three compilation albums, five extended plays and 26 singles in Sweden.[2] Between November 1964 and April 1968, Tages were considered one of the four most popular bands in Sweden,[3][4][nb 1] with 13 of their singles reaching the top 10 of the national record chart Tio i Topp including two number one singles.[5][nb 2] The band also released a string of commercially successful studio albums, with two of them, Tages (1965) and Tages 2 (1966), selling over 10,000 copies each in Sweden, enough for them to be certified gold.[6][7][8]  Towards the end of the 1960s, Tages' popularity started diminishing, and they charted their final top 10 single in April 1968.[9] Lead vocalist Blom left the band at the end of their folkpark tour in August 1968.[10][11] The group continued on as a quartet, with the group's sixth studio album and final five singles being released under the name Blond,[12] a name which was chosen by the band's management who believed it to be more internationally viable.[13][14] They broke up during the summer of 1970 after several personnel changes.[15]"

      "content": "Tages' first 10 singles and three studio albums were released in Sweden by Platina Records, an independent record label founded by Evert Jakobsson.[16][17] The band had signed a contract with the label in September 1964.[16] Platina was distributed by EMI Records starting in 1965,[14][17] causing singles by Tages released in the UK during this time period to appear on several EMI sublabels, including Columbia and His Master's Voice.[18] Tages founded their own publishing company, Segat AB, during the spring of 1966,[19][nb 3] which ensured that \"income reached the right [band members'] pockets\", contrary to many other publishing companies during the 1960s.[14] Platina's contract with Tages expired on New Year's Day 1967, upon which they opted to sign a contract with Parlophone instead.[20][11] This caused Jakobsson to issue archival material by Tages on Platina concurrently to their new releases on Parlophone in an act of retaliation.[21] In preparation for a potential international breakthrough, Tages' new manager Richard-Reese Edwards got the band signed to Fontana Records, negotiating an advance of $50,000 ($428,721 in 2024), a sum previously unheard of by a Swedish pop group.[22]"

      "content": "Starting with two unauthorized albums compiled by Jakobsson during the 1960s,[21] Tages' music has been collected on several compilation albums.[11] As the band's masters were owned by three separate record labels, the band's early compilation albums were restricted to the material each label had the rights to.[23] In 1983, Jakobsson licensed an album's worth of his Tages Platina masters to EMI, who were putting together the compilation album Tages, 1964-68![24][23] Later during the 1980s, Sven-Åke Peterson of EMI negotiated with Jakobsson, purchasing the masters from him.[25] In 1994, the 3-CD career-spanning box set This One's For You was released, containing almost every recording by Tages under that name.[25] The Blond recordings are still owned by Universal Music Group,[25] who issued all of their material with the band on the 2003 reissue of The Lilac Years.[26]"
