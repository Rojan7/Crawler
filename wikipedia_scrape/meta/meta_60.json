On 7 October 2023, Hamas-led militant groups launched a surprise attack on Israel, in which 1,195 Israelis and foreign nationals, including 815 civilians, were killed, and 251 taken hostage with the stated goal of forcing Israel to release Palestinian prisoners. Since the start of the Israeli offensive that followed, over 61,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed,[p] almost half of them women and children, and more than 150,000 injured.[79][80][18] A study in The Lancet estimated 64,260 deaths in Gaza from traumatic injuries by June 2024, while noting a potentially larger death toll when \"indirect\" deaths are included.[14][81][82][83] As of May 2025, a comparable figure for traumatic injury deaths would be 93,000.[84]"

Israeli forces launched numerous campaigns during the invasion, including the Rafah offensive from May 2024, three battles fought around Khan Yunis, and the siege of North Gaza from October 2024, and have assassinated Hamas leaders inside and outside of Gaza. A temporary ceasefire in November 2023 broke down, and a second ceasefire in January 2025 ended with a surprise attack by Israel in March 2025."

The Israel Defense Forces violently suppressed the protests, killing hundreds and injuring thousands of Palestinians by sniper fire.[141][142] Soon after a short 2021 conflict occurred, Hamas's military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, started planning an operation against Israel, which became the 7 October attacks.[143][144] According to diplomats, Hamas had repeatedly said in the months leading up to October 2023 that it did not want another military escalation in Gaza as it would worsen the humanitarian crisis that occurred after the 2021 conflict.[134]"

These actions have been criticized as having backfired in light of the attacks on 7 October 2023.[158][159][160] US President Joe Biden has said the aim of the 7 October attacks was to disrupt the Saudi–Israel normalization talks.[161]"

At the start of the war, Israel tightened its blockade on the strip, resulting in significant shortages of fuel, food, medication, water, and essential medical supplies.[614][617][618] This siege resulted in a 90% drop in electricity availability, impacting hospital power supplies, sewage plants, and shutting down the desalination plants that provide drinking water.[619] In July 2024, available water worked out to 4.74 litres per person per day, just under a third of the recommended minimum in emergencies.[620] Doctors warned of disease outbreaks spreading due to overcrowded hospitals.[615] A polio epidemic was the target of mostly-successful vaccination campaigns.[621]"

Vox reported that the news organizations \"have to submit all materials and footage to the IDF for review before publication\".[764] The conflict has also seen large numbers of journalists wounded or killed in action. On 14 December, CBS reported on a statement from the International Federation of Journalists that \"the number of journalists killed in the past two months in the war in Gaza has surpassed the amount killed in the Vietnam War, which lasted two decades\".[765] Reporters Without Borders filed a complaint with the International Criminal Court under section 8.2.b of the Rome Statute, accusing Israel of committing war crimes against eight journalists.[766][764] It also lodged a complaint against Hamas under section 8.2.a of the Rome Statute for the killing of a reporter covering the 7 October attack.[766] The Committee to Protect Journalists accused Israel of targeting journalists reporting from Gaza and their families, saying that in at least two cases, \"journalists reported receiving threats from Israeli officials and Israel Defense Forces officers before their family members were killed\".[767]"
