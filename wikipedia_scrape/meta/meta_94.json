      "content": "Rimington was born Stella Whitehouse on 13 May 1935[3] in South London, England; her family moved out of South Norwood in 1939, because of the dangers of living in London during World War II, to Essex, where her father was hired as chief draughtsman at a steelworks and later in Barrow-in-Furness, Cumbria. She described living through the Barrow Blitz as a small child, and becoming claustrophobic into adulthood, needing an exit route from any situation.[4] She was educated at Croslands Convent School[5] after spending some time in Wallasey. When her father found another job in Ilkeston, Derbyshire, the family moved to the Midlands, where Stella attended Nottingham High School for Girls. She spent her last summer of secondary school working as an au pair in Paris, before enrolling at the University of Edinburgh in 1954 to study English. By chance, she met her future husband, John Rimington, whom she had known from Nottingham.[6]\nCompleting her degree in 1958, she studied archive administration at the University of Liverpool, before beginning work as an archivist at the County Record Office in Worcester in 1959. In 1963, she married John Rimington and moved to London, where she successfully applied for a position at the India Office Library.[7]"

On 16 July 1993, MI5 (with the reluctant approval of the British Government) published a 36-page booklet titled The Security Service, which revealed publicly, for the first time, details of MI5's activities, operations and duties, as well as the identity and even photographs of Rimington as Director General.[6]"
