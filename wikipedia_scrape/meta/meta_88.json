      "content": "A guy-wire, guy-line, guy-rope, down guy, or stay, also called simply a guy, is a tensioned cable designed to add stability to a freestanding structure. They are used commonly for ship masts, radio masts, wind turbines, utility poles, and tents. A thin vertical mast supported by guy wires is called a guyed mast.  Structures that support antennas are frequently of a lattice construction and are called \"towers\".  One end of the guy is attached to the structure, and the other is anchored to the ground at some distance from the mast or tower base.  The tension in the diagonal guy-wire, combined with the compression and buckling strength of the structure, allows the structure to withstand lateral loads such as wind or the weight of cantilevered structures. They are installed radially, usually at equal angles about the structure, in trios and quads. As the tower leans a bit due to the wind force, the increased guy tension is resolved into a compression force in the tower or mast and a lateral force that resists the wind load. For example, antenna masts are often held up by three guy-wires at 120Â° angles. Structures with  predictable lateral loads, such as electrical utility poles, may require only a single guy-wire to offset the lateral pull of the electrical wires at a spot where the wires change direction.[1]"

      "content": "Utility poles are buried in the ground and have sufficient strength to stand on their own; guys are needed on some poles only to support unbalanced lateral loads from the utility wires attached to them, or to resist ground movement. Guys are particularly needed on dead-end (anchor) poles, where a long straight section of wire line ends, or angles off in another direction. To protect the public against faults that might allow utility guy cables to become electrified, they usually have a ceramic strain insulator (\"Johnny ball\") or a fiberglass strain insulator inserted near the top, to keep dangerous voltages away from the lower end. The length near the ground is often encased in a yellow plastic reflector to make it more visible, so that people or vehicles do not run into it."

Thus, the bottom length of the guy is vertical and does not obstruct headroom, so a sidewalk can pass between the pole and the guy."

      "content": "Electromagnetic fields from the antennas complicate the design of guys that support mast antennas. Conductive metal guy-wires whose lengths are near to quarter wavelength multiples of the transmitted frequency can distort the radiation pattern of the antenna. This also applies to guy wires of neighboring masts or nearby metal structures. To prevent this, each guy wire is divided by strain insulators into multiple sections, each segment non-resonant at the transmitted wavelength. Cylindrical or egg-shaped porcelain \"Johnny ball\" insulators (also called \"egg insulators\") are usually used. Non-conductive guys of Kevlar fiber (Phillystran) or extruded fiberglass rod are frequently used to not disturb the radiation pattern of the antennas. The strength and low stretch properties of Kevlar fiber approaches that of steel. However, Kevlar is very susceptible to ultraviolet degradation, so it is enclosed in a UV resistant plastic sheath."

      "section": "Antenna mast guy-wires",
      "content": "The individual sections of conductive guys can develop large charges of static electricity, especially on very tall masts. The voltage caused by this static electricity can be several times larger than that generated by the transmitter. In order to avoid dangerous and unpredictable discharges, the insulators must be designed to withstand this high voltage, which  on tall masts results in over-dimensioned backstage insulators. At each backstage insulator, a lightning arrestor in the form of an arc gap is required for the purpose of over-voltage protection in case of lightning strikes. The insulators and arrestors must be maintained carefully, because an insulator failure can result in a mast collapse. Egg insulators have the porcelain in compression and if it fails, the end loops of the guy wires are still intertwined."

In these cases, the guys are fixed without an insulator on the mast, but there is at least one insulator in the guy if necessary. If guys are used for feeding the mast with high frequency power it is often possible to use a grounded mast. The power to the guys is fed via wires running from a tuning unit to the feed point on the guys."

In situations where structures are at risk of collapse due to fire damage, guy wires can also help stabilize them temporarily while firefighters work to control the blaze. Guywires can also be used to raise an extension ladder in a technique called a church raise.[3]"

Since the guy wire exerts its force at an angle, the anchor has both vertical and lateral (horizontal) forces on it.  The anchor relies on the lateral shear strength of the soil to resist the forces from all of the guys attached to it.  Several types of anchor are used:"

Modern forms are the plate anchor, in which the guy is attached to a rod with an eyelet extending from the center of a steel plate buried diagonally, perpendicular to the angle of the guy.  In the concrete anchor, a diagonal rod with an eyelet extending in the guy direction is cemented into a hole filled with steel reinforced concrete.
