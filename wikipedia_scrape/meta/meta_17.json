Founded in 1724 and based in the commune of Cognac, it is among the oldest cognac producers still in existence.[1] and one of the \"big four\" cognac houses (along with Hennessy, Courvoisier and Martell), responsible for producing most of the world's cognac.[2] The brand specialises in creating Cognac Fine Champagne."

On his death in 1773, the business passed to his grandson, also named Rémy.[6] In 1841, Paul-Emile-Rémy Martin assumed control and oversaw great growth. He added a logo to the bottles and cases; a centaur after Sagittarius, Martin's own zodiac sign. The Rémy Martin logo continues; in China it's réntóumă (人头马), literally \"man-headed horse\".[7]"

Rémy Martin cognacs were then sold worldwide. After World War II, Rémy Martin continued to rise under André Hériard-Dubreuil, André Renaud's son-in-law. At the death of André Renaud in 1965, André Hériard-Dubreuil became president.[8] His children joined him, notably his daughter Dominique Hériard-Dubreuil who became general manager in 1988, and president two years later. In 1991, the House of Rémy Martin incorporated Rémy Cointreau into the business.[9]"

      "content": "Rémy Martin cognacs have the Cognac Fine Champagne appellation, meaning they come only from a blend of eaux-de-vie from the Grande Champagne and Petite Champagne crus, with at least 50% Grande Champagne. Being from chalky soils, these eaux-de-vie have ageing potential and a particular aroma due to the terroir.  In the 1960s, l’Alliance Fine Champagne (the Fine Champagne Alliance) was created by André Hériard Dubreuil of the House of Rémy Martin. This cooperative brings together vintners from Petite Champagne and Grande Champagne, and supplies almost 90% of the eaux-de-vie of the House.[11] Rémy Martin produces more than 80% of Fine Champagne cognacs."

      "content": "Rémy Martin uses traditional distillation of the lees (sediment from grape fermentation) in small copper stills. Ageing takes place in oak barrels of the Limousin type, during which alcohol evaporates (the angels' share), blackening the walls of the cellar. The eau-de-vie evolves, punctuated by resting and changes of barrel. The exchanges of wood, oxygen and eaux-de-vie are constant."

The oldest cognacs may be stored in glass demi-johns[12] (also called dame-jeannes) to prevent excessive evaporation. Finally, products from different aged spirits are mixed, to create a cognac."
