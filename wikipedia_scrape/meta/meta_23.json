      "content": "Garage rock (sometimes called garage punk or '60s punk) is a raw and energetic style of rock music that flourished in the mid-1960s, most notably in the United States and Canada, and has experienced a series of subsequent revivals.  The style is characterized by basic chord structures played on electric guitars and other instruments, sometimes distorted through a fuzzbox, as well as often unsophisticated and occasionally aggressive lyrics and delivery. Its name derives from the perception that groups were often made up of young amateurs who rehearsed in the family garage, although many were professional."

      "content": "In the US and Canada, surf rock—and later the Beatles and other beat groups of the British Invasion—motivated thousands of young people to form bands between 1963 and 1968.  Hundreds of grass-roots acts produced regional hits, some of which gained national popularity, usually played on AM radio stations.  With the advent of psychedelia, numerous garage bands incorporated exotic elements into the genre's primitive stylistic framework. After 1968, as more sophisticated forms of rock music came to dominate the marketplace, garage rock records largely disappeared from national and regional charts, and the movement faded. Other countries in the 1960s experienced similar rock movements that have sometimes been characterized as variants of garage rock."

Between 1971 and 1973, certain American rock critics began to retroactively identify the music as a genre and for several years used the term \"punk rock\" to describe it, making it the first form of music to bear the description, predating the more familiar use of the term appropriated by the later punk rock movement that its musical approach influenced.  The term \"garage rock\" gained favor amongst commentators and devotees during the 1980s.  The style has also been referred to as \"proto-punk\", or, in certain instances, \"frat rock\"."

Later in the decade, a louder, more contemporary garage subgenre developed that combined garage rock with modern punk rock and other influences, sometimes using the garage punk label originally and otherwise associated with 1960s garage bands.  In the 2000s, a wave of garage-influenced acts associated with the post-punk revival emerged, and some achieved commercial success.  Garage rock continues to appeal to musicians and audiences who prefer a \"back to basics\" or the \"DIY (Do-It-Yourself)\" musical approach."

Punk rock at its best is the closest we came in the 1960s to the original rockabilly spirit of rock & roll.\"[37]  In addition to Rolling Stone and Creem, writings about the genre appeared in various independent \"fanzine\" publications during the period.[38]  In May 1973, Billy Altman launched the short-lived punk magazine,[c][38] which pre-dated the more familiar 1975 publication of the same name, but, unlike the later magazine, was largely devoted to discussion of 1960s garage and psychedelic acts.[38]  Greg Shaw's seasonal publication, Who Put the Bomp!, was influential amongst enthusiasts and collectors of the genre in the early 1970s.[39]"

The signature garage sound that eventually emerged in the Pacific Northwest is sometimes referred to as \"the Northwest Sound\" and had its origins in the late 1950s, when a handful of R&B and rock & roll acts sprang up in various cities and towns in an area stretching from Puget Sound to Seattle and Tacoma, and beyond.[61]"

Numerous acts sometimes characterized as garage rock formed in countries outside North America, such as England's the Troggs.[89]  Their 1966 worldwide hit \"Wild Thing\" became a staple in countless American garage bands' repertoires.[90]  By 1965, the influence of the British Invasion prompted folk musicians such as Bob Dylan and members of the Byrds to adopt the use of electric guitars and amplifiers, resulting in what became termed folk rock.[91]  The resulting success of Dylan, the Byrds, and other folk rock acts influenced the sound and approach of numerous garage bands.[91]"

Garage acts, while generally lacking the budgetary means to produce musical extravaganzas on the scale of the Beatles' Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band or the instrumental virtuosity of acts such as Jimi Hendrix or Cream, nonetheless managed to infuse esoteric elements into basic primitive rock.[312] The 13th Floor Elevators from Austin, Texas, are usually thought to be first band to use the term \"psychedelic\"—in their promotional literature in early 1966.[175]  They also used it in the title of their debut album released in November, The Psychedelic Sounds of the 13th Floor Elevators.  In August 1966, the Deep traveled from New York to Philadelphia to record a set of hallucinogenic songs for the album Psychedelic Moods: A Mind-Expanding Phenomena, released in October 1966, one month before the 13th Floor Elevators' debut album, and whose all-night sessions produced mind-expanding stream of consciousness ramblings.[313]  Other notable bands that incorporated psychedelia into garage rock were the Electric Prunes, the Music Machine, the Blues Magoos,[314] and the Chocolate Watchband.  Garage rock helped lay the groundwork for the acid rock of the late 1960s.[315]"

The Fugs, who formed in 1963, were one of rock's first experimental bands and its core members were singer, poet, and social activist Ed Sanders, along with Tuli Kupferberg and Ken Weaver.[319]  They specialized in a satirical mixture of amateurish garage rock, jug, folk, and psychedelic laced with leftist political commentary.[319][320]  In a 1970 interview, Ed Sanders became the first known musician to describe his music as \"punk rock\".[34][321]"
