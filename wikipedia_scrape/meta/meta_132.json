The suspended sentence allowed him to contest the Lok Sabha bypolls from Amritsar.[124] In 2018, a bench headed by Justices Chalemeswar and Sanjay Kishan Kaul let the two off with a fine of ₹ 1,000 without any jail term, saying \"there was no evidence to prove that the death was caused by the single blow\" dealt by Sidhu.

The court noted that the hand can also be used as a \"weapon by itself where a boxer, wrestler, cricketer, or an extremely physically fit person inflicts a blow.\" The court said, \"The blow was not inflicted on a person identically physically placed but a 65-year-old person, more than double his age. Respondent no.1 (Sidhu) cannot say that he did not know the effect of the blow or plead ignorance on this aspect.\" \"It is not as if someone has to remind him of the extent of the injury which could be caused by a blow inflicted by him. In the given circumstances, tempers may have been lost but then the consequences of the loss of temper must be borne.\" Sidhu was judged guilty of the offence of simple hurt under section 323 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). On 19 May 2022, the Supreme Court convicted him for voluntarily causing hurt (Section 323 of the Indian Penal Code) and sentenced him to 1 year rigorous imprisonment. Section 323 (punishment for voluntarily causing hurt) of IPC has a maximum jail term of up to one year or a fine up to Rs 1,000 or both.[7]"
