A barrel of oil, defined as 42 US gallons (35 imp gal; 160 L), is still used as a measure of volume for oil, although oil is no longer shipped in barrels. The barrel has also come into use as a generic term for a wooden cask of any size."

Roman coopers tended to be independent tradesmen, passing their skills on to their sons. The Greek geographer Strabo (c. 64 BC – c. 24 AD) recorded that wooden pithoi (barrels or wine-jars) were lined with pitch to stop leakage and preserve the wine.[14]"

When a wine or spirit ages in a barrel, small amounts of oxygen are introduced as the barrel lets some air in (compare to microoxygenation where oxygen is deliberately added). Oxygen enters a barrel when water or alcohol is lost due to evaporation, a portion known as the \"angels' share\". In an environment with 100% relative humidity, very little water evaporates and so most of the loss is alcohol, a useful trick if one has a wine with very high proof. Most beverages are topped up from other barrels to prevent significant oxidation, although others such as vin jaune and sherry are not."

Barrels used for aging are typically made of French or American oak, but chestnut and redwood are also used. Some Asian beverages (e.g., Japanese sake) use Japanese cedar, which imparts an unusual, minty-piney flavor. In Peru and Chile, a grape distillate named pisco is either aged in oak or in earthenware."

Some winemakers use \"200% new oak\", where the wine is put into new oak barrels twice during the aging process. Bulk wines are sometimes more cheaply flavored by soaking in oak chips or added commercial oak flavoring instead of being aged in a barrel because of the much lower cost."

These finishing barrels frequently aged a different spirit (such as rum) or wine.

However, in higher humidities, more alcohol than water will evaporate, therefore reducing the alcoholic strength of the product.
