A total of 3,600 athletes from 204 National Olympic Committees (NOCs) participated in 201 events in 26 sports.[1][2][a] Events took place at eighteen competition venues,[5] of which eleven were pre-existing venues, one was newly constructed for the Olympics, and six were temporary venues that would be removed following the Games. Another twelve venues were set aside for training purposes.[6] The Youth Olympic Village was a separate non-competitive venue that provided accommodation and activities for the athletes.[7]"

The 55,000-seater National Stadium was not used as it was undergoing demolition to make way for Singapore Sports Hub, which houses the new National Stadium, expected to open after the Games.[12] Discounting venues which do not have spectator seating such as the National Sailing Centre,[13] the smallest venue in terms of seating capacity was the Kallang Field which could hold 500.[9]"

Located in Nanyang Technological University (NTU), it was divided into two zones: the Residential Zone and the Village Square. The Residential Zone consisted of NTU's ten Halls of Residence, namely Halls 3 and 8 to 16. While two of the halls (Halls 3 and 16) were recently completed, most were existing halls with students who were forced to move out temporarily to make way for the event.[31] The Village Square included the World Culture Village, which itself held performances, educational programmes, retail outlets, currency exchangers, and a post office. It was made to serve as a congregating area for the athletes.[7][32]"

However, rising construction costs worldwide as cited by the SYOGOC prompted a shift to NTU.[36] The new US$423 million (S$598 million) construction project at NTU commenced work in 2008 and was completed in 2010.[37] The Straits Times announced in July 2010 that hydrogen-electric hybrid buses would be used to ferry participants around the YOV, being among the first green buses to be used in Singapore.[38] A sculpture, titled The Wind and Wings, was specially made to commemorate the world's first Youth Olympic Village. It was unveiled by president of Singapore S. R. Nathan on 1 August 2010. The sculpture was made up of three tonnes of stainless steel and was sculpted by artist Yeo Chee Kiong.[39]"
