      "content": "Tiffin was born in Salisbury, Southern Rhodesia (now Harare, Zimbabwe).  His family were farmers in the Tengwe area in the north of the country.  Tiffin was educated at Banket Primary School and Prince Edward High School in Harare, where he became a wicketkeeper-batsman. After three years of military service, he played for Mashonaland in the days before Zimbabwean provincial cricket had first-class status, while working as a manager for Castrol Zimbabwe. He became an umpire in 1986, but continued with his day job until May 2002, when he became a full-time umpire."
