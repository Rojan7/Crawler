Although the river Charente became silted up and was unnavigable for much of the twentieth century, in the eighteenth century it provided important links with coastal shipping routes both for traditional businesses and for newly evolving ones such as paper goods and iron smelting.[citation needed]"

Economic ruin came to many in the Charentais wine industry with the arrival in 1872 of phylloxera.[citation needed]"
