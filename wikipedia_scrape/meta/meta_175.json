ECB policy requires all umpires to retire when they reach this age, in order to allow younger umpires to gain employment.[6] Sharp and fellow Northamptonshire team-mate and umpire Peter Willey challenged this decision at an employment tribunal, alleging age discrimination on the part of the ECB, but lost their case.[7]"
