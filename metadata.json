    "content": "The Diamond Smugglers is a non-fiction book by Ian Fleming published in November 1957. The book is based on two weeks of interviews Fleming undertook with John Collard, a member of the International Diamond Security Organisation (IDSO) and a former member of MI5; the IDSO was headed by Sir Percy Sillitoe (pictured), the ex-head of MI5 who worked for the diamond company De Beers. The IDSO was formed by Sillitoe to combat the smuggling of diamonds from Africa; it was estimated that £10 million worth of gems were being smuggled every year out of South Africa alone. The book expands upon a series of articles that Fleming wrote for The Sunday Times in 1957. The Diamond Smugglers is one of two non-fiction books written by Fleming. It received mixed reviews, although critics thought the subject was interesting and that the facts were as interesting as works of fiction. There was interest in turning the book into a film, but the plans did not come to fruition. (Full article...)"

To accommodate the 3,600 athletes from 204 different National Olympic Committees, eleven existing sites were used, six temporary sites were built, and one new site was built for permanent use after the Olympics. Organised by the Singapore Youth Olympic Games Organising Committee after winning the hosting bid in 2008, the Singapore Turf Club was the only venue constructed to host the equestrian events, while others like the Singapore Indoor Stadium and The Float @ Marina Bay (pictured) were upgraded for the Olympics. The largest venue was The Float@Marina Bay (the venue of the opening and closing ceremonies), with seating for 25,000, while the smallest venue was for the archery events at Kallang Field, with seating for 500.

    "content": "Cognac is a type of brandy named after the commune of Cognac in western France. Cognac production falls under French appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) designation, which stipulates that it must be grown in a specific wine-growing region in the departments of Charente and Charente-Maritime. The AOC also mandates that particular grapes (of which St. Émilion is the most common) be used, and that the drink be twice distilled in copper pot stills and aged at least two years in oak barrels from designated surrounding areas of France. Close to 200 cognac producers exist, of which the largest producers are Courvoisier, Hennessy, Martell and Rémy Martin. This photograph shows cognac in a snifter, a glass with a large tapered bowl and a short stem that allows the drinker to enjoy the aroma by placing their hand underneath the bowl and warming the cognac."

That was the thrust of that,\" he stated.[4]"

He answered: \"Music is a healing vibration that fills me. I believe people as well when they hear a song they like, it does something for you. When you get into art or you hear a great piece of music, your life kind of just gets into that very moment that you're living in. And that's really beautiful.\"[6]"

    "content": "The Battle of Amiens, also known as the Third Battle of Picardy  was the opening phase of the Allied offensive which began on 8 August 1918, later known as the Hundred Days Offensive, which ultimately led to the end of World War I. Allied forces advanced over 11 kilometres (7 mi) on the first day, one of the greatest advances of the war, with Gen Henry Rawlinson's British Fourth Army, with nine of its 19 divisions supplied by the fast-moving Australian Corps of Lt General John Monash and Canadian Corps of Lt General Arthur Currie, and Gen Marie Eugène Debeney's French First Army playing a decisive role. The battle is also notable for its effects on both sides' morale and the large number of surrendering German forces. This led Erich Ludendorff to later describe the first day of the battle as \"the black day of the German Army\". Amiens was one of the first major battles involving armoured warfare."

After the signing of the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk with revolutionary-controlled Russia, the Germans were able to transfer hundreds of thousands of men to the Western Front, giving them a significant, if temporary, advantage in manpower and materiel. These offensives were intended to translate this advantage into victory. Operation Michael was intended to defeat the right wing of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF), but a lack of success around Arras ensured the ultimate failure of the offensive. A final effort was aimed at the town of Amiens, a vital railway junction, but the advance had been halted at Villers-Bretonneux by British and Australian troops on 4 April.[7]"

At the same time, the Australian Corps under Lieutenant General John Monash held the right flank and linked up with French armies to the south. On 30 May, all the Australian infantry divisions were united under the corps HQ for the first time on the Western Front. The Australians had mounted several local counter-attacks which both revealed the suitability of the open and firm terrain south of the Somme for a larger offensive, and established and refined the methods which were to be used.[12][13]"

Rawlinson opposed this as his and Monash's plans depended on the large-scale use of tanks (now finally available in large numbers) to achieve surprise by avoiding a preliminary bombardment. The French First Army lacked tanks and would be forced to bombard the German positions before the infantry advance began, thus removing the element of surprise. Eventually, it was agreed that the French would participate but not launch their attack until 45 minutes after the Fourth Army.[7] It was also agreed to advance the proposed date of the attack from 10 to 8 August to strike the Germans before they had completed their withdrawal from the Marne salient."

The fire plan for the Fourth Army's artillery was devised by Monash's senior artillery officer, Major General C. E. D. Budworth. British sound ranging advances in artillery techniques and aerial photographic reconnaissance made it possible to dispense with \"ranging shots\" to ensure accurate fire. Budworth had produced a timetable which allowed 504 out of 530 German guns[17] to be hit at \"zero hour\", while a creeping barrage preceded the infantry. This method was similar to the Feuerwalze which the Germans themselves had used in their Spring Offensive, but its effectiveness was increased by the surprise achieved.[18]"

British reinforcements were transferred from the Home Army in Britain and the Sinai and Palestine Campaign. The German commanders realised in early August that their forces might be forced onto the defensive, though Amiens was not considered to be a likely front. The Germans believed the French would probably attack the Saint-Mihiel front east of Rheims, or in Flanders near Mount Kemmel, while they believed the British would attack along either the Lys or near Albert. The Allies had indeed mounted several local counter-offensives in these sectors to gain local objectives, improve their defensive positions, and distract attention from the Amiens sector. German forces began withdrawing from the Lys and other fronts in response to these theories. The Allies maintained equal artillery and air fire along their various fronts, moving troops only at night and feigning movements during the day to mask their actual intent.[citation needed]"

The German division (a specially selected and trained Stosstruppen formation) penetrated roughly 800 yards (730 m) into the one-and-a-half-mile front.[22] This attack was made in retaliation for a trench raid by the 5th Australian Division north of the Somme on the night of 31 July, which had taken many prisoners before the Australian Corps was concentrated south of the river.[23] The German division moved back towards its original position on the morning of 7 August, but the movement still required changes to the Allied plan."

The French 1st Army under General Debeney opened its preliminary bombardment at the same time and began its advance 45 minutes later, supported by a battalion of 72 Whippet tanks.[7][page needed] Although German forces were on the alert, this was mainly in anticipation of possible retaliation for their incursion on the sixth[26] and not because they had learned of the preplanned Allied attack. Although the two forces were within 460 metres (500 yd) of one another, gas bombardment was very low, as the bulk of the Allied presence was unknown to the Germans. The attack was so unexpected that German forces only began to return fire after five minutes, and even then, at the positions where the Allied forces had assembled at the start of the battle and had long since left.[27]"

The Germans had started the war with the Schlieffen Plan before the Race to the Sea slowed movement on the Western Front, and the war devolved into trench warfare. The German spring offensive earlier in 1918 had once again given Germany the offensive edge on the Western Front. Armoured support helped the Allies tear a hole through trench lines, weakening once-impregnable trench positions: the British Third Army, with no armoured support, had almost no effect on the line, while the Fourth, with fewer than a thousand tanks, broke deep into German territory.[7]"

When a wine or spirit ages in a barrel, small amounts of oxygen are introduced as the barrel lets some air in (compare to microoxygenation where oxygen is deliberately added). Oxygen enters a barrel when water or alcohol is lost due to evaporation, a portion known as the \"angels' share\". In an environment with 100% relative humidity, very little water evaporates and so most of the loss is alcohol, a useful trick if one has a wine with very high proof. Most beverages are topped up from other barrels to prevent significant oxidation, although others such as vin jaune and sherry are not."

The subsequent Pacific-wide tsunami was weaker than expected, with waves approximately 1 m (3 ft) or less in most places.[9] However, a locally high run-up of 19 m (62 ft) as a result of a wave splash was recorded on Shumshu.

It is believed to have ruptured a 700 km (430 mi) by 150–200 km (93–124 mi) section of the subduction zone from Shipunskii Cape in the north to Onekotan in the south. Unlike most large subduction earthquakes, the greatest fault movement in the 1952 event occurred at greater depth instead of being closer to the trench. Movement on the fault was inferred to be as deep as 40 km (25 mi) and possibly 60–80 km (37–50 mi). Little slip occurred at the trench, leaving it locked and accumulating unreleased elastic energy.[12]"

These events are often associated with the preparatory process of a large earthquake on an active fault. An analysis of earthquakes from 1973 to late 2024, including the 17 August 2024 Mw  7.0 earthquake and its aftershocks off the peninsula revealed three ring-shaped seismicity structures at 0–33 km (0–21 mi), 34–70 km (21–43 mi), and 71–110 km (44–68 mi). Existing studies reported that a large earthquake usually occurs about 10 to 15 years after a sudden high rate of seismicity around these structures, and in the Kamchatka area, this occurred in 2016. Based on the current knowledge, the paper said there was a likelihood of a large earthquake occurring between 2026 and 2031 with a moment magnitude of 8.4–8.8.[15]"

    "content": "A finite fault model released by the USGS indicated slip on an approximately 600 km (370 mi) by 200 km (120 mi) section of the subduction zone and up to a depth of 75 km (47 mi). A majority of the rupture extended 500 km (310 mi) southwest along the subduction zone from the epicenter to the southern tip of Onekotan Island while some slip occurred 100 km (62 mi) northwest heading towards and under Cape Shipunskii. A 400 km (250 mi) by 150 km (93 mi) patch on the fault plane at 10–50 km (6.2–31.1 mi) depth to the southwest of the epicenter exhibited the highest slip. There, at 20–50 km (12–31 mi) depth, at least 5 m (16 ft) of displacement occurred and there were two elliptical areas within where slip exceeded 10 m (33 ft), peaking at 14.5423 m (47.711 ft). At shallower depth near the trench, the slip was limited to 2.5–3 m (8 ft 2 in – 9 ft 10 in).[3] The GEOSCOPE Observatory estimated that the earthquake ruptured the subduction zone for a duration of more than 180 seconds.[24] The USGS estimated the earthquake's duration to be about 240 seconds.[3]"

On his death in 1773, the business passed to his grandson, also named Rémy.[6] In 1841, Paul-Emile-Rémy Martin assumed control and oversaw great growth. He added a logo to the bottles and cases; a centaur after Sagittarius, Martin's own zodiac sign. The Rémy Martin logo continues; in China it's réntóumă (人头马), literally \"man-headed horse\".[7]"

At the death of André Renaud in 1965, André Hériard-Dubreuil became president.[8] His children joined him, notably his daughter Dominique Hériard-Dubreuil who became general manager in 1988, and president two years later. In 1991, the House of Rémy Martin incorporated Rémy Cointreau into the business.[9]"

Being from chalky soils, these eaux-de-vie have ageing potential and a particular aroma due to the terroir.  In the 1960s, l’Alliance Fine Champagne (the Fine Champagne Alliance) was created by André Hériard Dubreuil of the House of Rémy Martin. This cooperative brings together vintners from Petite Champagne and Grande Champagne, and supplies almost 90% of the eaux-de-vie of the House.[11] Rémy Martin produces more than 80% of Fine Champagne cognacs."

The newspaper published a four-page Insight investigation, titled \"The Thalidomide File\", in the \"Weekly Review\" section. On 17 November 1972, the Queen's Bench Divisional Court issued an injunction to prevent The Sunday Times from publishing further articles, as it was feared that the paper's campaign might affect ongoing lawsuits over the ensuing scandal. The newspaper appealed to the European Court of Human Rights, which found that the injunction violated the publisher's right to freedom of expression, noting that the articles were moderate and balanced and thus unlikely to disrupt proceedings.[16] A compensation settlement for the UK victims was eventually reached with Distillers Company (now part of Diageo), which had distributed the drug in the UK.[citation needed]"

In return, Murdoch provided legally binding guarantees to preserve the titles' editorial independence.[citation needed]"

It also built on its reputation for investigations. Its scoops included the revelation in 1986 that Israel had manufactured more than 100 nuclear warheads[18] and the publication in 1992 of extracts from Andrew Morton's book, Diana: Her True Story in Her Own Words. In the early 1990s, the paper courted controversy with a series of articles in which it rejected the role of HIV in causing AIDS.[citation needed]"

The plant, which allowed journalists to input copy directly, was activated with the help of the Electrical, Electronic, Telecommunications and Plumbing Union (EETPU). The print unions posted pickets and organised demonstrations outside the new plant to try to dissuade journalists and others from working there, in what became known as the Wapping dispute. The demonstrations sometimes turned violent. The protest ended in failure in February 1987.[citation needed]"

The figures are now in and this newspaper stands totally vindicated ... The history of Aids is one of the great scandals of our time. I do not blame doctors and the Aids lobby for warning that everybody might be at risk in the early days, when ignorance was rife and reliable evidence scant.\" He criticised the \"AIDS establishment\" and said \"Aids had become an industry, a job-creation scheme for the caring classes.\"[23]"

This increased GDP but also increased income inequality over the next two decades.[1] A UN-authorized coalition force from 34 nations fought against Iraq, which had invaded and annexed Kuwait in the previous year, 1990.

    "content": "Garage rock (sometimes called garage punk or '60s punk) is a raw and energetic style of rock music that flourished in the mid-1960s, most notably in the United States and Canada, and has experienced a series of subsequent revivals.  The style is characterized by basic chord structures played on electric guitars and other instruments, sometimes distorted through a fuzzbox, as well as often unsophisticated and occasionally aggressive lyrics and delivery. Its name derives from the perception that groups were often made up of young amateurs who rehearsed in the family garage, although many were professional."

Hundreds of grass-roots acts produced regional hits, some of which gained national popularity, usually played on AM radio stations.  With the advent of psychedelia, numerous garage bands incorporated exotic elements into the genre's primitive stylistic framework. After 1968, as more sophisticated forms of rock music came to dominate the marketplace, garage rock records largely disappeared from national and regional charts, and the movement faded. Other countries in the 1960s experienced similar rock movements that have sometimes been characterized as variants of garage rock."

Between 1971 and 1973, certain American rock critics began to retroactively identify the music as a genre and for several years used the term \"punk rock\" to describe it, making it the first form of music to bear the description, predating the more familiar use of the term appropriated by the later punk rock movement that its musical approach influenced.  The term \"garage rock\" gained favor amongst commentators and devotees during the 1980s.  The style has also been referred to as \"proto-punk\", or, in certain instances, \"frat rock\"."

Later in the decade, a louder, more contemporary garage subgenre developed that combined garage rock with modern punk rock and other influences, sometimes using the garage punk label originally and otherwise associated with 1960s garage bands.  In the 2000s, a wave of garage-influenced acts associated with the post-punk revival emerged, and some achieved commercial success.  Garage rock continues to appeal to musicians and audiences who prefer a \"back to basics\" or the \"DIY (Do-It-Yourself)\" musical approach."

Punk rock at its best is the closest we came in the 1960s to the original rockabilly spirit of rock & roll.\"[37]  In addition to Rolling Stone and Creem, writings about the genre appeared in various independent \"fanzine\" publications during the period.[38]  In May 1973, Billy Altman launched the short-lived punk magazine,[c][38] which pre-dated the more familiar 1975 publication of the same name, but, unlike the later magazine, was largely devoted to discussion of 1960s garage and psychedelic acts.[38]  Greg Shaw's seasonal publication, Who Put the Bomp!, was influential amongst enthusiasts and collectors of the genre in the early 1970s.[39]"

The signature garage sound that eventually emerged in the Pacific Northwest is sometimes referred to as \"the Northwest Sound\" and had its origins in the late 1950s, when a handful of R&B and rock & roll acts sprang up in various cities and towns in an area stretching from Puget Sound to Seattle and Tacoma, and beyond.[61]"

Such acts had a profound impact, leading many (often surf or hot rod groups) to respond by altering their style, and countless new bands to form, as teenagers around the country picked up guitars and started bands by the thousands.[85]  In many cases, garage bands were particularly influenced by the increasingly bold sound of a second wave of British groups with a harder, blues-based attack, such as the Kinks, the Who, the Animals, the Yardbirds, Small Faces, Pretty Things, Them,[86][87] and the Rolling Stones[88] often resulting in a raw and primitive sound.  Numerous acts sometimes characterized as garage rock formed in countries outside North America, such as England's the Troggs.[89]  Their 1966 worldwide hit \"Wild Thing\" became a staple in countless American garage bands' repertoires.[90]  By 1965, the influence of the British Invasion prompted folk musicians such as Bob Dylan and members of the Byrds to adopt the use of electric guitars and amplifiers, resulting in what became termed folk rock.[91]  The resulting success of Dylan, the Byrds, and other folk rock acts influenced the sound and approach of numerous garage bands.[91]"

With thousands of garage bands active in the US and Canada, hundreds produced regional hits during the period,[92] often receiving airplay on local AM radio stations.[93]  Several acts gained wider exposure just long enough to have one or occasionally more national hits in an era rife with \"one-hit wonders\".[94] In 1965, the Beau Brummels broke into the national charts with \"Laugh, Laugh\", followed by \"Just a Little\".[95]  According to Richie Unterberger, they were perhaps the first American group to pose a successful response to the British Invasion.[96] That year, Sam the Sham & the Pharaohs' \"Wooly Bully\" went to No. 2, and they followed it up a year later with another No. 2 hit, \"Little Red Riding Hood\".[97]  Also in 1965, the Castaways almost reached Billboard's top ten with \"Liar, Liar\", which was later included on the 1972 Nuggets compilation.[98]  Featuring a lead vocal by Rick Derringer, \"Hang On Sloopy\" became a No. 1 hit for Indiana's the McCoys,[99] topping the Billboard charts in October 1965.[100] They were immediately signed to Bang Records and followed up with another hit in 1966, a cover of \"Fever\", originally recorded by Little Willie John.[99]"

In their 1964 transatlantic hits \"You Really Got Me\" and \"All Day and All of the Night\", the Kinks took the influence of the Kingsmen's version of \"Louie Louie\" and applied greater volume and distortion, which in turn, influenced the approach of many American garage bands.[213]  With Van Morrison, Them recorded two songs widely covered by American garage bands: \"Gloria\", which became a big hit for Chicago's the Shadows of Knight, and \"I Can Only Give You Everything\".[214][215] Keith Richards's use of fuzz distortion in the Rolling Stones' 1965 hit \"(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction\" affected the sound of countless American garage bands.[216]  Also influential were the Pretty Things and the Downliners Sect, both of whom were known for a particularly raw approach to blues-influenced rock that has sometimes been compared to garage.[217][218][219]"

In August 1966, the Deep traveled from New York to Philadelphia to record a set of hallucinogenic songs for the album Psychedelic Moods: A Mind-Expanding Phenomena, released in October 1966, one month before the 13th Floor Elevators' debut album, and whose all-night sessions produced mind-expanding stream of consciousness ramblings.[313]  Other notable bands that incorporated psychedelia into garage rock were the Electric Prunes, the Music Machine, the Blues Magoos,[314] and the Chocolate Watchband.

The Fugs, who formed in 1963, were one of rock's first experimental bands and its core members were singer, poet, and social activist Ed Sanders, along with Tuli Kupferberg and Ken Weaver.[319]  They specialized in a satirical mixture of amateurish garage rock, jug, folk, and psychedelic laced with leftist political commentary.[319][320]  In a 1970 interview, Ed Sanders became the first known musician to describe his music as \"punk rock\".[34][321]"

The Punks had a sometimes thrashing sound that caught the attention of rock journalist Lester Bangs, and their song \"My Time's Comin'\" was retroactively featured in a 2016 episode of HBO's Vinyl.[347]  In 1974, Death, whose membership was made up of brothers David, Bobby, and Dannis Hackney, recorded tracks for an album that remained unreleased for over 30 years, ...For the Whole World to See, which, along with the release of their other previously unissued tracks, finally earned them a reputation as pioneers in punk rock.[348][349][350]  Death's music anticipated the arrival of later African American punk acts such as the Bad Brains.[349]"

It differed from the \"retro\" revival in that its acts did not attempt to replicate the exact look and sound of 1960s groups, and their approach tended to be louder, often infusing garage rock with elements of Stooges-era proto-punk, 1970s punk rock, and other influences, creating a new hybrid.[383][384]  Several notable garage punk bands were the Gories, thee Mighty Caesars, the Mummies and thee Headcoats.[385]  Originally associated with the 1960s garage revival of the early 1980s, the Pandoras' sound became increasingly harder as decade progressed.[386]  Out of Japan came Guitar Wolf from Nagasaki[387] and the 5.6.7.8's from Tokyo.[388] Garage punk and revival acts persisted into the 1990s and the new millennium,[383] with independent record labels releasing records by bands playing fast-paced, lo-fi music.[389]  Some of the more prolific independent labels include Estrus,[390] Get Hip,[391] Bomp!,[392] and Sympathy for the Record Industry.[393]"

Playing a style indebted to '60s–'70s bands like the Velvet Underground and the Ramones, the band's intention musically was to sound like \"a band from the past that took a time trip into the future to make their record.\"[396] When the Strokes released their commercial debut, the public perception of \"rock music\" was based in post-grunge, nu metal and rap rock, putting their throwback style of garage rock as a stark contrast to the mainstream.[397] The Strokes were accompanied in this commercial breakthrough by the White Stripes and the Hives, who according to music critic Jim DeRogatis, all had a sound \"to some extent rooted in Nuggets-era garage rock\".[398]"

For example, the post-credits scene of Iron Man 2 (2010) shows S.H.I.E.L.D. agent Phil Coulson locating a large hammer at the bottom of a crater in a New Mexico desert, thus teasing the release of Thor the following year; while the post-credits sequence of Captain America: The Winter Soldier (2014) introduces the characters of Pietro and Wanda Maximoff, who join the franchise in Avengers: Age of Ultron (2015). Other times, these mid- and post-credits scenes serve primarily as gags, such as the post-credits scene in The Avengers (2012), which has the team eating shawarma in a derelict restaurant in the aftermath of the film's climactic battle, or Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017), which features Captain America educating the audience on patience.[8][9] The Incredible Hulk (2008) does not include a proper post-credits scene; however, its final scene, in which Tony Stark approaches Thaddeus Ross in a bar, is often treated as one.[1][2][3] Avengers: Endgame (2019) also does not feature a post-credits scene, instead having the credits end with the sound of clanging metal first heard in Iron Man.[10]"

They felt that a road map was needed for where the credit scenes were heading and that \"Marvel popularized the post-credits phenomenon – now it needs to reinvent them.\"[59] Multiple other critics have shared the same opinion about the growing number of unresolved teases from Phases Four and Five.[60][61][62] Screen Rant added that one of the major issues with the credit scenes in Phase Four and early Phase Five was the amount of new characters introduced. The MCU's first three phases introduced eight new characters over the eleven-year span, while Phases Four and Five had already introduced more by early 2023, which was only a two-year span from the beginning of Phase Four.[63] Writing for Digital Spy, David Opie singled out the credit scene in The Marvels featuring Beast by saying that it could be years before the scene pays off with there being no plans in the near future for a live action X-Men project. He said \"the X-Men are a huge deal and it makes sense that their full-on return might take some time\", but added that the issue is this was not the first time that Marvel played the long game with their credit scene teases and that there have been many huge developments over the recent years, \"then never mentioned again\".[60] Nick Staniforth from /Film said the post-credits scene for Thunderbolts* was a \"tease-worthy moment\" and harkened back to the \"classic MCU post-credit moments we've missed these past few years\".[64]"

Screen Rant later described this as \"Marvel's first post-credit scene\", and noted that this is one of several significant post-credits scenes that were not followed up on in later films.[6] The post-credits scene in Deadpool (2016) featured the title character, who is known for breaking the fourth wall, appearing in a bathrobe and telling the audience that the movie is over—identical to the post-credits scene in the 1986 comedy, Ferris Bueller's Day Off—while also saying \"What? Are you expecting Sam Jackson to show up in a eye patch?\", referencing the appearance of Nick Fury in the Iron Man post-credits scene.[65] In Sony's Spider-Man Universe (SSU) film Venom: Let There Be Carnage (2021), Eddie Brock and Venom decide to take a tropical vacation while they ponder their next steps. As Venom tells Brock about the symbiotes' knowledge of other universes, a blinding light transports them from their hotel room to another room where they watch J. Jonah Jameson talk about Spider-Man's identity as Peter Parker on television, as was previously revealed in Spider-Man: Far From Home.[29][66] Similarly, in Morbius (2022), the first mid-credits scene features Adrian Toomes finding himself transported to the SSU, while in the second, Toomes approaches Dr. Michael Morbius, suggesting they should form a team;[67] and in Venom: The Last Dance (2024), a mid-credits scene shows Knull exclaiming that the universe is no longer safe from him, and a post-credit scene shows a bartender escaping Area 51 in a panic, while a cockroach appears to be fused with the Venom symbiote.[68]"

The specificity of an AOC product is determined by the combination of a physical and biological environment with established production techniques transmitted within a human community.

These factors are meant to capture unique environmental features (e.g. type of soil, topology of the production environment, local climate) and farming and processing practices (e.g. the steps taken and inputs used in producing a specific type of cheese).

For example, there are a dozen townships in l'Aude that have Cabardès in their names, several of which are not even within the geographical boundaries of the Cabardès AOC.

Overall, the appellation of a wine simply says where the grapes are from, although there are some particularities. If the appellation is a state, 100% of the grapes which go into the wine must come from the specific state. If a winery gets grapes from a neighboring state (for example, a California vintner getting Pinot noir from Oregon), it may label the wine \"Oregon\", but if the state is not a neighboring one (for example, a California vintner getting Cabernet from Washington state), the only permitted appellation is \"American\".[18]"

Initially designated the prefecture in 1790 (having been Saintonge’s capital), Saintes lost this status in 1810 when Napoleon decreed its transfer to La Rochelle.[6] The region, under Merovingian and Carolingian rule, oscillated between kingdom and duchy status until Carolingian decline spurred instability, shaping Aunis’ distinct identity."

The 19th century brought prosperity under the Second Empire, driven by cognac, until the phylloxera crisis struck."

Most snifters will hold 180–240 ml (6–8 US fl oz), but are almost always filled to only a small part of their capacity. Most snifters are designed so that when placed sideways on a level surface, they will hold just the proper amount before spilling.[1]"

Another account holds that the building project was assigned to a military manager and an architect.  The architect presented the manager with a requisition for the total number of bricks that he would need.  When the manager found out that the architect had not asked for any extra bricks, he demanded that the architect make some provision for unforeseen circumstances.  The architect, taking this as an insult to his planning ability, added a single extra brick to the request.  When the gate was finished, the single extra brick was, in fact, extra and was left on the ledge over the gate.[60]"

Before departing Dunhuang they would pray to the Mogao Grottoes for a safe journey, if they came back alive they would thank the gods at the grottoes. Across the desert they would form a train of camels to protect themselves from thieving bandits. The next stop, Kashi (Kashgar), was a welcome sight to the merchants. At Kashi most would trade and go back and the ones who stayed would eat fruit and trade their Bactrian camels for single humped ones.

All Cognac is produced by blending a variety of eau de vie which can be made from grapes from different locations, and from different vintages.

(English terms are still used, since in the early days of Cognac production it was the British who were the main consumers and also became some of the main producers of Cognac, using techniques acquired from the distillation of whisky, etc.)  These are controlled by the length of time the Cognac is allowed to mature in oak barrels, a minimum time being required at each grade level.  The longer the Cognac matures in the barrel the smoother it will generally become.  Once it is bottled no further development takes place.  Most houses still have barrels of Cognac dating back to the 19th century sitting in their cellars waiting for fine blending by the Cellar Master."

    "content": "The Diamond Smugglers is a non-fiction book by Ian Fleming published in November 1957. The book is based on two weeks of interviews Fleming undertook with John Collard, a member of the International Diamond Security Organisation (IDSO) and a former member of MI5; the IDSO was headed by Sir Percy Sillitoe (pictured), the ex-head of MI5 who worked for the diamond company De Beers. The IDSO was formed by Sillitoe to combat the smuggling of diamonds from Africa; it was estimated that £10 million worth of gems were being smuggled every year out of South Africa alone. The book expands upon a series of articles that Fleming wrote for The Sunday Times in 1957. The Diamond Smugglers is one of two non-fiction books written by Fleming. It received mixed reviews, although critics thought the subject was interesting and that the facts were as interesting as works of fiction. There was interest in turning the book into a film, but the plans did not come to fruition. (Full article...)"

Cognac production falls under French appellation d'origine contrôlée (AOC) designation, which stipulates that it must be grown in a specific wine-growing region in the departments of Charente and Charente-Maritime. The AOC also mandates that particular grapes (of which St. Émilion is the most common) be used, and that the drink be twice distilled in copper pot stills and aged at least two years in oak barrels from designated surrounding areas of France. Close to 200 cognac producers exist, of which the largest producers are Courvoisier, Hennessy, Martell and Rémy Martin. This photograph shows cognac in a snifter, a glass with a large tapered bowl and a short stem that allows the drinker to enjoy the aroma by placing their hand underneath the bowl and warming the cognac."

    "content": "Although today the Brazilian Women's National Team is one of the best in the world, it was not that long ago that women were not even allowed to watch a game. The women's game filtered sporadically throughout Brazil with popular traction in the early 20th century. Magazines such as O imparcial and Jornal dos sports covered the women's game praising their achievements in local cup competitions.[3] Yet, the traditional order of futbol as \"purely masculine\" came into contention resulting in the games downfall. Until, the mid-1940s when Brazil became a dictatorship subsequently banning the women's game.[4]"

Throughout the time of the ban, women were observed playing quite frequently forcing the Conselho Nacional de Desportos (CND) to take charge and reissue bans that were not working. In 1965, Deliberation no. 7 further forced an end to all women's sports in Brazil, not just football.[4] This ban would not be lifted until the late 1970s, when Brazil passed Amnesty Laws allowing political exiles back into the country.[4]"

Variations of the logo he chose, a swift in combination with the Martell family coat of arms, have been in use ever since.[4]"

They also developed an export business, and by 1814 Martell was the most consumed brandy in England. In 1831, Martell created its first V.S.O.P. cognac.[1] The use of English-language designations like \"very superior old pale\" and \"extra old\" reflected aged cognac's status as primarily an export product.[1]"

Late Old English borrowed some grammar and core vocabulary from Old Norse, a North Germanic language.[12][13][14] Then, Middle English borrowed vocabulary extensively from French dialects, which are the source of approximately 28 percent of Modern English words, and from Latin, which is the source of an additional 28 percent.[15] While Latin and the Romance languages are thus the source for a majority of its lexicon taken as a whole, English grammar and phonology retain a family resemblance with the Germanic languages, and most of its basic everyday vocabulary remains Germanic in origin. English exists on a dialect continuum with Scots; it is next-most closely related to Low Saxon and Frisian."

Old English developed from a set of West Germanic dialects, sometimes identified as Anglo-Frisian or North Sea Germanic, that were originally spoken along the coasts of Frisia, Lower Saxony and southern Jutland by Germanic peoples known to the historical record as the Angles, Saxons, and Jutes.[27] From the 5th century, the Anglo-Saxons settled Britain as the Roman economy and administration collapsed. By the 7th century, Old English had become dominant in Britain – replacing the Common Brittonic and British Latin previously spoken during the Roman occupation,[28][29][30] which ultimately left little influence on English. England and English (originally Ænglaland and Ænglisc) are both named after the Angles.[31]"

During the earliest period of Old English, a few short inscriptions were made using a runic alphabet.[35] By the 6th century, a Latin alphabet had been adopted. Written with half-uncial letterforms, it included the runic letters wynn ⟨ƿ⟩ and thorn ⟨þ⟩, and the modified Latin letters eth ⟨ð⟩, and ash ⟨æ⟩.[35][36]"

    "content": "Old English is a markedly different from Modern English, such that 21st-century English speakers are entirely unable to understand Old English without special training. Its grammar was similar to that of modern German: nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs had many more inflectional endings and forms, and word order was much freer than in Modern English. Modern English has case forms in pronouns (he, him, his) and has a few verb inflections (speak, speaks, speaking, spoke, spoken), but Old English had case endings in nouns as well, and verbs had more person and number endings.[37][38][39] Its closest relative is Old Frisian, but even some centuries after the Anglo-Saxon migration, Old English retained considerable mutual intelligibility with other Germanic varieties. Amidst the Danelaw and other Viking invasions, there is evidence that Old Norse and Old English retained considerable mutual intelligibility into the 9th and 10th centuries, though northern dialects of Old English were likely more similar to Old Norse than southern dialects were. As late as the 10th century, it would have been possible for commoners from certain parts of northern England to converse with those from certain parts of Scandinavia.[40][better source needed]"

    "content": "Between the 8th and 11th centuries, the English spoken in some regions underwent significant changes due to contact with Old Norse, a North Germanic language. Several waves of Norsemen colonising the northern British Isles in the 8th and 9th centuries put Old English speakers in constant contact with Old Norse. Norse influence was strongest in the north-eastern varieties of Old English spoken in the Danelaw surrounding York; today these features are still particularly present in Scots and Northern English. The centre of Norse influence was Lindsey, located in the Midlands. After Lindsey was incorporated into the Anglo-Saxon polity in 920, English spread extensively throughout the region. An element of Norse influence that continues in all English varieties today is the third person pronoun group beginning with th- (they, them, their) which replaced the Anglo-Saxon pronouns with h- (hie, him, hera).[41]"

Over the following decades of contact, members of the middle and upper classes, whether native English or Norman, became increasingly bilingual. By 1150 at the latest, bilingual speakers represented a majority of the English aristocracy, and monolingual French speakers were nearly non-existent.[44] The French spoken by the Norman elite in England eventually developed into the Anglo-Norman language.[45]"

The distinction between nominative and accusative cases was lost except in personal pronouns, the instrumental case was dropped, and the use of the genitive case was limited to indicating possession. The inflectional system regularised many irregular inflectional forms,[47] and gradually simplified the system of agreement, making word order less flexible.[48]"

By the 12th century Middle English was fully developed, integrating both Norse and French features; it continued to be spoken until the transition to Early Modern English c. 1500. Middle English literature includes Geoffrey Chaucer's Canterbury Tales, and Thomas Malory's Le Morte d'Arthur.

    "content": "The period of Early Modern English, lasting between 1500 and 1700, was characterised by the Great Vowel Shift (1350–1700), inflectional simplification, and linguistic standardisation. The Great Vowel Shift affected the stressed long vowels of Middle English. It was a chain shift, meaning that each shift triggered a subsequent shift in the vowel system. Mid and open vowels were raised, and close vowels were broken into diphthongs. For example, the word bite was originally pronounced as the word beet is today, and the second vowel in the word about was pronounced as the word boot is today. The Great Vowel Shift explains many irregularities in spelling since English retains many spellings from Middle English, and it also explains why English vowel letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other languages.[52][53]"

    "content": "English began to rise in prestige, relative to Norman French, during the reign of Henry V. Around 1430, the Court of Chancery in Westminster began using English in its official documents, and a new standard form of Middle English, known as Chancery Standard, developed from the dialects of London and the East Midlands. In 1476, William Caxton introduced the printing press to England and began publishing the first printed books in London, expanding the influence of this form of English.[54] Literature from the Early Modern period includes the works of William Shakespeare and the 1611 King James Version (KJV) of the Bible. Even after the vowel shift the language still sounded different from Modern English: for example, the consonant clusters /kn ɡn sw/ in knight, gnat, and sword were still pronounced. Many of the grammatical features that a modern reader of Shakespeare might find quaint or archaic represent the distinct characteristics of Early Modern English.[55]"

Commerce, science and technology, diplomacy, art, and formal education all contributed to English becoming the first truly global language. English also facilitated worldwide international communication.[57][4] English was adopted in parts of North America, parts of Africa, Oceania, and many other regions. When they obtained political independence, some of the newly independent states that had multiple indigenous languages opted to continue using English as the official language to avoid the political and other difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others.[58][59][60]"

In 1755, Samuel Johnson published his Dictionary of the English Language, which introduced standard spellings of words and usage norms. In 1828, Noah Webster published the American Dictionary of the English language to try to establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent of the British standard. Within Britain, non-standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes.[66]"

(Earlier English did not use the word do as a general auxiliary as Modern English does; at first it was only used in question constructions, and even then was not obligatory.[67] Now, do-support with the verb have is becoming increasingly standardised.) The use of progressive forms in -ing, appears to be spreading to new constructions, and forms such as had been being built are becoming more common. Regularisation of irregular forms also slowly continues (e.g. dreamed instead of dreamt), and analytical alternatives to inflectional forms are becoming more common (e.g. more polite instead of politer). British English is also undergoing change under the influence of American English, fuelled by the strong presence of American English in the media.[68][69][70]"

Many regional international organisations, such as the European Free Trade Association (EFTA), Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN),[64] and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) use English as their sole working language, despite most members not being countries with a majority of native English speakers. While the EU allows member states to designate any of the national languages as an official language of the Union, in practice English is the main working language of EU organisations.[125] English serves as the basis for the required controlled natural languages[126] Seaspeak and Airspeak, used as international languages of seafaring[127] and aviation.[128]"

The next most commonly mentioned foreign language, French (which is the most widely known foreign language in the UK and Ireland), could be used in conversation by 12 percent of respondents.[130] The global influence of English has led to concerns about language death,[131] and to claims of linguistic imperialism,[132] and has provoked resistance to the spread of English; however, the number of speakers continues to increase because many people around the world think English provides them with better employment opportunities and increased quality of life.[133]"

Unlike other Indo-European languages, English has largely abandoned the inflectional case system in favour of analytic constructions. Only the personal pronouns retain morphological case more strongly than any other word class. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections.[179] English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as have and do, expressing the categories of mood and aspect. Questions are marked by do-support, wh-movement (fronting of question words beginning with wh-) and word order inversion with some verbs.[180]"

They can also include modifiers such as adjectives (e.g. red, tall, all) and specifiers such as determiners (e.g. the, that). But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such as and, or prepositions such as with, e.g. the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles (this NP uses conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers, and modifiers). Regardless of length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit.[180] For example, the possessive enclitic can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity, follow the entire noun phrase, as in The President of India's wife, where the enclitic follows India and not President."

Examples of phrasal verbs are to get up, to ask out, to get together, and to put up with. The phrasal verb frequently has a highly idiomatic meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement (e.g. lay off meaning terminate someone's employment).[213] In spite of the idiomatic meaning, some grammarians, including Huddleston & Pullum (2002:274), do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term \"phrasal verb\".

Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase I think (that) you are lying, the main clause is headed by the verb think, the subject is I, but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause (that) you are lying. The subordinating conjunction that shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted.[219] Relative clauses are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence I saw the letter that you received today, the relative clause that you received today specifies the meaning of the word letter, the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns who, whose, whom, and which as well as by that (which can also be omitted.)[220] In contrast to many other Germanic languages there are no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.[221]"

Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb. For example, in the sentence the dog did not find its bone, the clause find its bone is the complement of the negated verb did not. Subject–auxiliary inversion is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions."

    "content": "The verb do can be used as an auxiliary even in simple declarative sentences, where it usually serves to add emphasis, as in \"I did shut the fridge.\" However, in the negated and inverted clauses referred to above, it is used because the rules of English syntax permit these constructions only when an auxiliary is present. Modern English does not allow the addition of the negating adverb not to an ordinary finite lexical verb, as in *I know not – it can only be added to an auxiliary (or copular) verb, hence if there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required, the auxiliary do is used, to produce a form like I do not (don't) know. The same applies in clauses requiring inversion, including most questions – inversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb, so it is not possible to say *Know you him?; grammatical rules require Do you know him?[222]"

A passive construction rephrases an active construction in such a way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase, and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase. They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb to be or to get, although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with get.

In most cases, interrogative words (or wh-words) – which include who, what, when, where, why, and how – appear in a fronted position. For example, in the question What did you see?, the word what appears as the first constituent despite being the grammatical object of the sentence. When the wh-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs (e.g. Who saw the cat?). Prepositional phrases can also be fronted when they are the questions theme (e.g. To whose house did you go last night?). The personal interrogative pronoun who is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant whom serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.[225]"

    "content": "While English is a subject-prominent language, at the discourse level it tends to use a topic–comment structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally has to be the grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, it is often promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, the girl was stung by the bee. Another way is through a cleft sentence where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a dummy subject such as it or there, e.g. it was the girl that the bee stung, there was a girl who was stung by a bee.[226] Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., it is raining) or in existential clauses (there are many cars on the street). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic–comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax."

For example, That girl over there, she was stung by a bee, emphasises the girl by preposition, but a similar effect could be achieved by postposition, she was stung by a bee, that girl over there, where reference to the girl is established as an afterthought.[228]"

Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, no way is that true!

While few scholars agree with Chomsky and Halle (1968) that conventional English orthography is \"near-optimal\",[254] there is a rationale for current English spelling patterns.[258] The standard orthography of English is the most widely used writing system in the world.[259] Standard English spelling is based on a graphomorphemic segmentation of words into written clues of what meaningful units make up each word.[260]"

Digraphs used to represent phonemes and phoneme sequences include ch for /tʃ/, sh for /ʃ/, th for /θ/ or /ð/, ng for /ŋ/, qu for /kw/, and ph for /f/ in Greek-derived words. The single letter x is generally pronounced as /z/ in word-initial position and as /ks/ otherwise.

This becomes all the more apparent considering social, ethnolinguistic, and regional varieties such as African-American English, Chicano English, Cajun English, or Newfoundland English.[282] American accent variation is increasing at the regional level and decreasing at the very local level,[283] though most Americans still speak within a phonological continuum of similar accents,[284] known collectively as General American English (GA), with differences hardly noticed even among Americans themselves, including Midland and Western American English.[285][286][287]"

It was influenced mostly by British and Irish English, as well as Irish, Scottish Gaelic, and Acadian French.[290]"

This contrasts with the situation in England, where non-rhoticity has become the standard.[291] Varieties beyond GA which have developed distinct sound systems include the Southern American English, New York City English, Eastern New England English, and African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) groups – all of which are historically non-rhotic, save a few varieties of Southern American."

    "content": "Spoken primarily by working- and middle-class African Americans, African-American Vernacular English (AAVE) is largely non-rhotic, and likely originated among enslaved Africans and African Americans influenced primarily by the non-standard older Southern dialects. A minority of linguists,[299] contrarily, propose that AAVE mostly traces back to African languages spoken by the slaves who had to develop a pidgin or English-based creole to communicate with slaves of other ethnic and linguistic origins.[300] AAVE's important commonalities with Southern accents suggest it developed into a highly coherent and homogeneous variety in the 19th or early 20th century. AAVE is commonly stigmatised in North America as a form of \"broken\" or \"uneducated\" English, as are white Southern accents, but linguists today recognise both as fully developed varieties of English with their own norms shared by large speech communities.[301][302]"

The English of neighbouring New Zealand has to a lesser degree become an influential standard variety of the language.[303] Australian and New Zealand English are each other's closest relatives with few differentiating characteristics, followed by South African English and the English of South East England, all of which have similarly non-rhotic accents, aside from some accents in the South Island of New Zealand. Australian and New Zealand English stand out for their innovative vowels: many short vowels are fronted or raised, whereas many long vowels have diphthongised. Australian English also has a contrast between long and short vowels, not found in most other varieties. Australian English grammar aligns closely with British and American English; like American English, collective plural subjects take on a singular verb (as in the government is rather than are).[304][305] New Zealand English uses front vowels that are often even higher than in Australian English.[306][307][308]"

In South Africa, English has been spoken since 1820, co-existing with Afrikaans and various African languages such as the Khoe and Bantu languages. Today, about nine percent of the South African population speaks South African English (SAE) as a first language. SAE is a non-rhotic variety that tends to follow RP as a norm. It is one of the few non-rhotic English varieties that lack intrusive R. The second-language varieties of South Africa differ based on the native languages of their speakers.[311] Most phonological differences from RP are in the vowels.[312] Consonant differences include the tendency to pronounce /p, t, t͡ʃ, k/ without aspiration (e.g. pin pronounced [pɪn] rather than as [pʰɪn] as in most other varieties), while r is often pronounced as a flap [ɾ] instead of as the more common fricative.[313]"

The most prominent varieties are Jamaican English and Jamaican Creole. In Central America, English-based creoles are spoken on the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Panama.[316] Residents are often fluent in both the local English variety and the local creole languages, and frequently code-switch between them. The relationship between different varieties can be conceptualised as a continuum, in which more creole-like or RP-like forms function as more formal and informal registers of the language respectively.[317]"

Gercke said that she was inspired by novels by Raymond Chandler and the Swedish team of authors Maj Sjöwall and Per Wahlöö.[5] Her book was a hit, and encouraged her to write more thrillers in a series, often including \"dense, sometimes ironically broken descriptions of the milieu\",[5] such as Moskau, meine Liebe (1989), Kinderkorn (1991), Schweigen oder Sterben (2007) and Zwischen Nacht und Tag (2012).[5]"

As of 2023, it has employed over 700 staff and contractors, with net assets of $255 million and an endowment which has surpassed $100 million."

    "content": "Jimmy Wales and Larry Sanger founded Wikipedia in 2001 as a feeder project to supplement Nupedia. The project was originally funded by Bomis, Wales's for-profit business, and edited by a rapidly growing community of volunteer editors. The early community discussed a variety of ways to support the ongoing costs of upkeep, and was broadly opposed to running ads on the site,[12] so the idea of setting up a charitable foundation gained prominence.[13] That addressed an open question of what entity should hold onto trademarks for the project."

Co-produced by Newton-John for ONJ Productions, Gaia was originally issued by Festival in Australia but also distributed by various independent labels in Japan and Europe. In 2002, there was an American distribution by Hip-O Records, and a subsequent re-release in 2012 by Green Hill featured an alternative cover photo.[109][110] Gaia was the first album on which Newton-John wrote all the music and lyrics herself, and this endeavour encouraged her to become more active as a songwriter thereafter. The single \"No Matter What You Do\" entered the Australian top 40, and the second single, the environmentally themed \"Don't Cut Me Down\", was also used in the film It's My Party, a 1996 AIDS drama. The Latin-fuelled \"Not Gonna Give into It\" eventually became heavily showcased in concert performance; \"The Way of Love\" was featured in the telefilm A Christmas Romance,[111] and \"Trust Yourself\" was incorporated into both the TV movie The Wilde Girls[112][better source needed] and the theatrical film Sordid Lives.[113]"

Its first single was a re-recording of \"I Honestly Love You\" produced by David Foster and featuring Kenneth \"Babyface\" Edmonds on background vocals[63] that charted on the Pop (No. 67) and AC (No. 18) charts. Country radio dismissed the song, though it did peak at No. 16 on the Country Sales chart.

    "content": "Her musical abilities on their own merits were also impressive. In her 1982 Olivia in Concert performance of Dolly Parton's \"Jolene,\" Newton-John showcases a down-falling note range covering three octaves. (Much later, Newton-John and Parton recorded a duet of \"Jolene,\" which was not formally released until after Newton-John's death.)[193] In her memoir, Newton-John describes herself as \"not a power singer but more of an interpretive one\";[194] and author Lauren O'Neill concurs: \"She sang with clarity and precision, her high notes bright and open like a window on a summer morning, but her voice was never clinical – a sultry purr, euphoric cry or breathy gasp seemed always available to her....Her vocal [on \"Hopelessly Devoted to You\" from Grease] is clean and soaring, but to hear it is to be right down in the dirt with Sandy too; to feel, and perhaps even identify with, her total frustration with herself. As she slides between notes while singing 'I'm out of my head,' she shows us her emotional freefall as well as telling us about it.\"[195]"

    "content": "Long before and after the career summit of Grease, Newton-John proved herself to be a fairly versatile performer, lending her instrument to everything from sentimental ballads and New Age soul searching to lively dance productions and rock & soul fervor. Maura Johnston of Vulture assesses: \"Newton-John was a regular chart-topper...throughout the '70s, her lithe soprano adapting well to the soft pop sound\" of the era with \"AM Gold staples and tracks from the folk and country world...As it turned out, Newton-John's voice was pretty well suited to the spiky dance pop that would become popular in the early 1980s\" too.[44] However, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of the Los Angeles Times offers a counterpoint on her career decline in the mid-1980s: \"Hardness never was Newton-John's comfort zone, though, and the 1980s were a much harder decade than the 1970s. The inherent warmth of 1970s studio sessions gave way to the cold, synthesized gleam of the 1980s, a sterile sound that suited her well only once: the candied faux-new wave of 'Twist of Fate'\", produced by David Foster.[196] Johnston further maintains: \"Her pop heyday transcended any attempts to musically pigeonhole her\"; and by the time she stopped having many new hits, \"her musical legacy ... had been pretty well solidified.\"[44]"

Some of that popularity might be attributable to the album's notoriously racy cover, which featured model Dolores Erickson seemingly clothed only in whipped cream. However, as writer Bruce Handy pointed out in a Billboard article, two other Brass albums, Going Places (1965) and What Now My Love (1966), \"held the third and fifth spots on the 1966 year-end chart despite pleasant yet far more anodyne covers.\"[26] Another measure of the band's popularity is that a number of Tijuana Brass songs were used as theme music for years by the ABC TV game show The Dating Game.[27]"

    "content": "Alpert's only No. 1 single during this period, and the first No. 1 hit for his A&M label, was a solo effort: \"This Guy's in Love with You\", written by Burt Bacharach and Hal David, featuring a rare vocal.[23][30] Alpert sang it to his first wife in a 1968 CBS Television special titled Beat of the Brass. The sequence was filmed on the beach in Malibu. The song was not intended to be released, but after it was used in the television special, allegedly thousands of telephone calls to CBS asking about it convinced Alpert to release it as a single, two days after the show aired.[31] Although Alpert's vocal skills and range were limited, the song's technical demands suited him.[32]"

    "content": "After years of success, Alpert had a personal crisis in 1969, declaring \"the trumpet is my enemy.\" He disbanded the Tijuana Brass, and stopped performing in public.[11] Eventually he sought out teacher Carmine Caruso, \"who never played trumpet a day in his life, (but) he was a great trumpet teacher.\"[33] \"What I found,\" Alpert told The New York Times, \"is that the thing in my hands is just a piece of plumbing. The real instrument is me, the emotions, not my lip, not my technique, but feelings I learned to stuff away—as a kid who came from a very unvocal household. Since then, I've been continually working it out, practicing religiously and now, playing better than ever.\"[11] The results were noticeable; as Richard S. Ginell wrote in an AllMusic review of Alpert's comeback album, You Smile - The Song Begins, \"His four-year sabbatical over, Herb Alpert returned to the studio creatively refreshed, his trumpet sounding more soulful and thoughtful, his ears attuned more than ever to jazz.\"[34]"

The song reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 after it was used repeatedly on the soap opera General Hospital. The song also became a hit in the UK, but in a speeded-up version, due to British DJs not realizing that the American 12\" single was recorded at 33 rpm instead of 45 rpm.[35] Its bass line would later be included in The Notorious B.I.G.’s “Hypnotize”, which itself would reach number one on the Hot 100.[36]"

England qualified for their third successive World Cup in August 2014 with a game to spare, winning all ten matches and topping Group 6.[31] England played their first international match at the new Wembley Stadium, home to the men's national team, in a friendly against the reigning European champions Germany on 23 November 2014.

They lost the match 3–0, marking the 20th attempt at which England had failed to record an official win over Germany.[32][33]\nAt the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup in Canada, England lost their opening group game to France but won their remaining group games against Mexico and Colombia, easing through to the last 16 to play 1995 champions Norway. A 2–1 win set up a meeting with hosts Canada in the quarter-finals. Despite facing not only a strong Canadian team but a capacity partisan crowd at BC Place in Vancouver, England progressed to the semifinals of the Women's World Cup for the first time in their history with another 2–1 win, which also marked the first semifinal appearance by any England senior team since the men reached the last four of the 1990 World Cup in Italy. Playing reigning World Cup holders Japan in the semi-finals, England conceded a penalty kick, which Aya Miyama converted past Karen Bardsley. Japan then conceded a penalty as Yuki Ogimi clipped Steph Houghton and Fara Williams slotted it past Ayumi Kaihori to level the game. However, in the last minute of the game, Laura Bassett scored an own goal to send Japan through to the final.[34] England eventually finished in third place by beating Germany 1–0 after extra time after a Williams penalty, their first time beating their archrivals in the women's game. It marked the best finish for any England senior team since the men's team famously won the 1966 World Cup as hosts.[35]"

It was first used as a hashtag in June 2012 when the men's team was competing in UEFA Euro 2012 at the same time the women's team was playing a crucial UEFA Women's Euro 2013 qualifier against Netherlands in a bid to help differentiate the coverage and allow people to follow the women's team more easily without getting lost in conversation about the men which was using the same generic #ThreeLions branding at the time. The name started to be used organically by fans and media outlets before The Football Association adopted it as an official brand identity, including with commercial and licensing partners, ahead of the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup.[82][83]"

Because of this compounded word, readers since the fifteenth century have often, and incorrectly, thought that the Roman authors Quintillian and Pliny described an ancient genre.[18] Following Noah Webster's spelling reform,[19] the spelling of the word varies between encyclopedia in American English, encyclopaedia in British English (although the spelling encyclopedia is increasingly gaining acceptance), and encyclopædia in certain specialized cases.[20]"

    "content": "The modern encyclopedia evolved from the dictionary in the 18th century; this lineage can be seen in the alphabetical order of print encyclopedias.[21] Historically, both encyclopedias and dictionaries have been compiled by well-educated, well-informed content experts, but they are significantly different in structure. A dictionary is a linguistic work that primarily focuses on an alphabetical listing of words and their definitions. Synonymous words and those related by the subject matter are to be found scattered around the dictionary, giving no obvious place for in-depth treatment. Thus, a dictionary typically provides limited information, analysis or background for the word defined.[22][23] While it may offer a definition, it may leave the reader lacking in understanding the meaning, significance or limitations of a term, and how the term relates to a broader field of knowledge.[24]"

An encyclopedia article also often includes many maps and illustrations, as well as bibliography and statistics.[5]"

The introduction of printing from Asia allowed a wider diffusion of encyclopedias and every scholar could have his or her copy. Nuremberg Chronicle from 1493 is one of the best-documented early printed books—an incunabulum—and one of the first to successfully integrate illustrations and text. Both Latin and German editions were printed by Anton Koberger in Nuremberg.[44] The De expetendis et fugiendis rebus by Giorgio Valla was posthumously printed in 1501 by Aldo Manuzio in Venice. This work followed the traditional scheme of liberal arts. However, Valla added the translation of ancient Greek works on mathematics (firstly by Archimedes), newly discovered and translated. The Margarita Philosophica by Gregor Reisch, printed in 1503, was a complete encyclopedia explaining the seven liberal arts."

    "content": "Financial, commercial, legal, and intellectual factors changed the size of encyclopedias. Middle classes had more time to read and encyclopedias helped them to learn more. Publishers wanted to increase their output so some countries like Germany started selling books missing alphabetical sections, to publish faster. Also, publishers could not afford all the resources by themselves, so multiple publishers would come together with their resources to create better encyclopedias. Later, rivalry grew, causing copyright to occur due to weak underdeveloped laws.\nJohn Harris is often credited with introducing the now-familiar alphabetic format in 1704 with his English Lexicon Technicum: Or, A Universal English Dictionary of Arts and Sciences: Explaining not only the Terms of Art, but the Arts Themselves – to give its full title. Organized alphabetically, its content does indeed contain an explanation not merely of the terms used in the arts and sciences, but of the arts and sciences themselves.

The best known of these were World Book and Funk and Wagnalls. As many as 90% were sold door to door.[33] Jack Lynch says in his book You Could Look It Up that encyclopedia salespeople were so common that they became the butt of jokes. He describes their sales pitch saying, \"They were selling not books but a lifestyle, a future, a promise of social mobility.\" A 1961 World Book ad said, \"You are holding your family's future in your hands right now,\" while showing a feminine hand holding an order form.[59] As of the 1990s, two of the most prominent encyclopedias published in the United States were Collier's Encyclopedia and Encyclopedia Americana.[60]"

The user would execute the encyclopedia's software program to see a menu that allowed them to start browsing the encyclopedia's articles, and most encyclopedias also supported a way to search the contents of the encyclopedia. The article text was usually hyperlinked and also included photographs, audio clips (for example in articles about historical speeches or musical instruments), and video clips. In the CD-ROM age, the video clips usually had a low resolution, often 160x120 or 320x240 pixels. Such encyclopedias which made use of photos, audio and video were also called multimedia encyclopedias."

Its transmitter, whose installation started in October 1973, entered regular service on 22 July 1974.[5] The opening of the mast was met with extensive celebration and was covered by the Polish Film Chronicle.[3][6] The tower was used by Warsaw Radio-Television (Centrum Radiowo-Telewizyjne) for radio broadcasting on a frequency of AM-LW (longwave) 227 kHz before 1 February 1988 and 225 kHz (1332m) afterwards.[7] Its base was 115.2 metres (378 ft) above sea level. Because there was a potential difference of 120 kV between the mast and ground, it stood on a 2-metre (6.6 ft)-high insulator. It operated as a mast radiator (half-wave radiator), so its height was half of its 1332m broadcasting wavelength. The signals from its 2 MW transmitters could be received across essentially the entire globe. The structure's weight was debated, with some Polish sources claiming it weighed 420 tonnes (930,000 lb).[1]"

The Raszyn transmitter was designed to cover the Eastern Borderlands, and so Polish authorities did not consider reception in the Recovered Territories. When it became evident that Raszyn could not provide coverage to the entire country, the station received an increase of power to 500 kW, but this too failed. In the late 1960s it was decided to construct a new central transmitter at the geographical centre of Poland (post-WWII borders). Gąbin was chosen not only due to its central position, but also its high soil conductivity.[10] During storms, when the mast could not operate, the signal would be temporarily switched to Raszyn, a process that was eased thanks to direct phone lines from RCN Konstantynów to both Raszyn and the energy sector.[10]"

The vertical steel tubes forming the structures of the mast had a diameter of 245 millimetres (10 in); the thickness of the walls of these tubes varied between 8–34 mm (0.31–1.33 in) depending on height. The mast consisted of 86 sections, each of which had a length of 7.5 metres (25 ft). The mast had 3 arrays of guy wires, each array attached to the mast at 5 levels: 121.78 metres (399.5 ft), 256.78 metres (842.5 ft), 369.28 metres (1,211.5 ft), 481.78 metres (1,580.6 ft), and 594.28 metres (1,949.7 ft) above ground.[11][5] Each guy was fixed on a separate anchor block at the ground and was 50 millimetres (2.0 in) in diameter. To prevent the guy wires from interfering with the radio transmissions, the guys were insulated at regular intervals. The weight of guys and insulators used to anchor the mast was 80 tonnes (180,000 lb).[12][13] An elevator and separate protected ladders were installed in the interior of the mast to facilitate access to the various mast components, including the aircraft warning lamps. The elevator was designed by Alimak Hek [sv], a Swedish company, and took 45 minutes to reach the top. The lift was nicknamed \"Alimak\", as a nod to the company that designed it. Safety was a priority, so \"Alimak\" had a safety procedure, where it could be stopped, but this precaution never had to be used. A maximum of 3 people could ride up the elevator, although sources claim it would be crowded. The elevator was powered by an internal combustion engine. An area for maintenance supplies was present, in order to transport materials such as lightbulbs for the aircraft warning lights. Inspection crews travelled up it once per month to replace light bulbs, and watch for cracks in the steel. If a crack was found, the transmitters were turned off and the Raszyn radio mast took over the broadcast. Any cracks were then fixed by welders from Mostostal Zabrze by making patches out of sheet metal.[14]"

This tube was grounded at the bottom, and connected electrically to the mast structure by an adjustable metal bar at a height of 328.68 metres (1,078.3 ft) when the tower transmitted on 227 kHz longwave and at a height of 334.18 metres (1,096.4 ft) when it switched to 225 kHz on 1 February 1988.[13] This technique allowed adjusting the impedance of the mast for the transmitter and worked by applying a direct current ground at a point of low radio frequency voltage, to conduct static charge to ground without diminishing the radio energy. Static electrical charge can build up to high values, even at times of no thunderstorm activity, when such tall structures are insulated from ground. Use of this technique provides better lightning protection than using just a spark gap at the mast base, as it is standard at most mast radiators insulated against ground.[12]"

Featuring an asymmetrical coaxial power supply, it consisted of the inner \"hot\" core of 24 copper wires connected to a small ring at each post, and each was connected by three insulated cables to the outer ring. The outer ring served as the support of another set of 24 wires, known as the \"outer braid.\" The transmission line was monitored whenever the mast was in operation; at night the line was illuminated with street lights, to prevent trespassers from electrocuting themselves.[16] The transmitter building had a volume of 17,000 cubic metres (600,000 cu ft) and was approximately 600 metres (2,000 ft) from the mast. The transmitter consisted of two 1,000 kW units built by Brown, Boveri & Cie. An atomic clock was used to generate the transmission frequency in order to provide a very accurate, stable signal source which could be used as a frequency standard by anyone within signal range. The transmitters had the ability for each component to be turned on manually or all be started with one button. The transmitters were capable of receiving remote input, but the devices needed to utilize this were not implemented in Konstanynów. When high-voltage power was switched on, the transmitter was protected by two locked doors and crews were informed by way of illuminating a red lightbulb. This lightbulb was controlled by a photodiode that would additionally flash the lightbulb if a short-circuit in the transmitter was detected."

Upon reaching the transmitters, a dehydrator ensured that no condensation occurred. The transmission building used a NEC radio set and the TN60 multiple telephony system. This allowed for 60 telephone lines connected to the Polska Poczta, Telegraf i Telefon fixed-line telephone network to be run off the station but the full possibilities of this system were never used.[17]"

    "content": "Approximately ten years after completion of the mast, inspections revealed structural damage caused by wind-induced oscillations at the mast, the backstay insulators and the guys. Repair work was considered to be expensive and difficult, so replacement of the mast by a stronger construction of the same height was considered; however, this was not carried out due to Poland's worsening economic situation. Repainting was started in 1988, but could not be completed because not enough paint was available.[19] A lack of equipment and training of maintenance teams led to a severe degradation of the mast's condition by the late 1980s. An inspection in May 1989 found that 13 strands of the upper guys had been fractured and, by the time of the collapse of the mast in 1991, seven guy wire insulators had been damaged. Another cause of the structure's deterioration was insufficient knowledge of the strains exerted on structures of such a great height. Additionally, on 23 March 1992, Adam Brzeziński, managing director of Mostostal Zabrze at the time, stated to Dziennik Zachodni that Mostostal should have prepared a technical report before starting construction on the risks faced during repair of a strained mast.[20]"

After the main cable had been disconnected and before the temporary ones could be connected, a gust of wind twisted the temporarily unmoored tower, pulling loose the other guys. The unsupported mast first bent, and then snapped at roughly half its height. The helix building and the transmitter building and transmitter were not damaged.[26] The transmission line was also unaffected, but it was dismantled shortly after the collapse of the tower, leaving only the sustaining poles in place. A mobile crane belonging to Mostostal Zabrze was destroyed when the tower collapsed. As the foreman did not keep a construction log it was hard to determine the exact events that led to the catastrophe.[20] The construction coordinator and the division chief of the company responsible for maintaining the mast were found liable for the collapse, and both were sentenced to 2.5 years in prison. The construction manager's sentence was eventually shortened to six months.[1][27][28]"

    "content": "After the collapse, Polskie Radio used the old Raszyn transmitter with its 335 metres (1,099 ft) mast near Warsaw, which had been used since 1978 for daytime transmissions of a second Polish broadcasting service programme in the longwave range on the frequency AM-LW 198 kHz, for transmissions on AM-LW 225 kHz with a power of 500 kW.[30] It is not possible to transmit from Raszyn on AM-LW (long wave) 198 kHz/1515 metres and 225 kHz/1333 metres simultaneously due to risk of interference, so the transmissions on the second longwave frequency AM-LW (long wave) 198 kHz had to be discontinued until either a second longwave broadcasting transmitting facility was built in Poland or a special frequency switch, which would allow transmissions on both frequencies, was installed at the Raszyn transmitter. The latter, simpler solution would have decreased the effectiveness and reliability of both transmitters and was therefore rejected.[8]"

    "content": "Because of the importance of Polish longwave transmitters to Polish people abroad, as early as April 1992 the Polish government planned to rebuild the mast at Konstantynów.[31] In September 1995 the Polish government was set to rebuild the mast. Although refurbishment of the old foundations, which could be reused, had already started, the rebuilding of the mast was cancelled due to protests by local residents, who claimed that radiation from the mast was a health hazard.[32] While the accuracy of these claims has not been verified, a new site for the transmitter was sought. Several other locations were considered, but due to the continuing resistance of nearby inhabitants (backed by the Solidarity trade union), planned mast height and transmitter range were both greatly reduced, and an old military site just southeast of Solec Kujawski was chosen.[33] There were once again protests in this location, but tensions were eased when Polish Radio donated PLN 3.5 million towards the development of the local community.[34] There, a new longwave transmission facility was built in 1998–1999, with a transmitter of 1200 kW output power for the frequency AM-LW (long wave) 225 kHz. This facility, which was inaugurated on 4 September 1999, uses one 330 metre (1083 ft) and one 289 metre (948 ft) grounded top-fed masts as aerials.[8]"

Already, the presidential entries are being edited, dissected and debated countless times each day.\"[301] An October 2007 Reuters article, titled \"Wikipedia page the latest status symbol\", reported the recent phenomenon of how having a Wikipedia article vindicates one's notability.[302]"

    "content": "In a 2017 opinion piece for Wired, Hossein Derakhshan describes Wikipedia as \"one of the last remaining pillars of the open and decentralized web\" and contrasted its existence as a text-based source of knowledge with social media and social networking services, the latter having \"since colonized the web for television's values\". For Derakhshan, Wikipedia's goal as an encyclopedia represents the Age of Enlightenment tradition of rationality triumphing over emotions, a trend which he considers \"endangered\" due to the \"gradual shift from a typographic culture to a photographic one, which in turn mean[s] a shift from rationality to emotions, exposition to entertainment\". Rather than \"sapere aude\" (lit. 'dare to know'), social networks have led to a culture of \"dare not to care to know\". This is while Wikipedia faces \"a more concerning problem\" than funding, namely \"a flattening growth rate in the number of contributors to the website\". Consequently, the challenge for Wikipedia and those who use it is to \"save Wikipedia and its promise of a free and open collection of all human knowledge amid the conquest of new and old television—how to collect and preserve knowledge when nobody cares to know.\"[306]"

    "content": "Cronqvist gained prominence in Sweden in the mid-1960s, creating not only paintings and graphics but textiles and sculptures. Her bold, intensive colourings contribute to her rather harsh expressionism, re-introducing a personalized approach in Swedish art. Depicting hospital scenes, Madonnas and girls playing morbid games, as well as many biographical portrayals, her work in the 1960s and 1970s frequently depicted scenes of anguish and illness.[5] She illustrated the books of her husband Göran and created a series of lithographs for Strindberg's Ett Drömspel.[4] As a sculptor, she worked with glass and bronze. Her artworks have been widely exhibited and are in the collections of Nationalmuseet and Moderna Museet in Stockholm.[2]"

The historian Hans Eberhard Mayer concludes from Elias's dictamina (art of letter-writing) that Elias too came from Anjou. Elias initially served as a notary under a chancellor named Franco. Franco was only nominally at the head of the chancery, however, because Elias composed all of King Fulk's charters–even if it was Franco who signed them. In 1136, Elias was promoted to chancellor.[1] The appointment to this office suggests that he was the king's confidant.[2] Along with the king's other confidants–Guy I Brisebarre, lord of Beirut, and William of Messines, Latin patriarch of Jerusalem–Elias attended the 1140 Council of Antioch which saw the deposition of the Latin patriarch of Antioch, Ralph of Domfront.[3]"

The Jerusalemite chancery had, since its inception, been a platform for climbing the church ranks, and Elias could not have refused this promotion.[5] The next recorded bishop of Tiberias was Gerald in 1174.[7]"

As of 2025, Russian troops occupy about 20% of Ukraine. From a population of 41 million, about 8 million Ukrainians had been internally displaced and more than 8.2 million had fled the country by April 2023, creating Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II."

Putin espoused irredentist and imperialist views challenging Ukraine's legitimacy as a state, baselessly claimed that the Ukrainian government were neo-Nazis committing genocide against the Russian minority in the Donbas, and said that Russia's goal was to \"demilitarise and denazify\" Ukraine.[19][20][21][22][23] Russian air strikes and a ground invasion were launched on a northern front from Belarus towards the capital Kyiv, a southern front from Crimea, and an eastern front from the Donbas and towards Kharkiv. Ukraine enacted martial law, ordered a general mobilisation, and severed diplomatic relations with Russia."

Russia continued to bomb military and civilian targets far from the front, and struck the energy grid during winter months. In late 2022, Ukraine launched successful counteroffensives in the south and east, liberating most of Kharkiv Oblast. Soon after, Russia illegally annexed four partly-occupied provinces. In November, Ukraine liberated Kherson. In June 2023, Ukraine launched another counteroffensive in the southeast but made few gains. After small but steady Russian advances in the east in the first half of 2024, Ukraine launched a cross-border offensive into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August, where North Korean soldiers were sent to assist Russia. The United Nations Human Rights Office reports that Russia is committing severe human rights violations in occupied Ukraine. The direct cost of the war for Russia has been over US$450 billion.[24][25][26]"

Many countries imposed sanctions on Russia and its ally Belarus and provided large-scale humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. The Baltic states and Poland declared Russia a terrorist state. Protests occurred around the world, with anti-war protesters in Russia being met by mass arrests and greater media censorship. The Russian attacks on civilians have led to allegations of genocide.[27][28][29][30] War-related disruption to Ukrainian agriculture and shipping contributed to a world food crisis; war-related local environmental damage has been described as ecocide and the war has heavily disrupted global climate policy. The International Criminal Court (ICC) opened an investigation into crimes against humanity, war crimes, abduction of Ukrainian children, and genocide against Ukrainians. The ICC issued arrest warrants for Putin and five other Russian officials."

The total value of raw material stocks in Ukraine is estimated at over $26 trillion.[24] The value of lithium and rare earths in Ukraine is estimated at $11.5 trillion.[78] In January 2024, the Russian occupation government in Donetsk Oblast granted the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources permission to mine lithium in the Shevchenko deposit near Kurakhovo, which is estimated to be worth hundreds of billions of US dollars.[24]"

    "content": "The December 2021 Russian ultimatum to NATO, included demands that NATO end activity in its Eastern European member states and ban Ukraine or any former Soviet state from ever joining the alliance.[18][92][93] Russia's government said NATO was a threat and warned of a military response if it followed an \"aggressive line\".[94] Some demands had already been ruled out by NATO. A US official said the US was willing to discuss the proposals, but there were some \"the Russians know are unacceptable\".[92] Eastern European states willingly joined NATO for security reasons, and the last time a country bordering Russia had joined was in 2004. Ukraine had not yet applied, and some members were wary of letting it join.[95] Barring Ukraine would go against NATO's \"open door\" policy, and against treaties agreed to by Russia.[96] NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg replied that \"Russia has no say\" on whether Ukraine joins, and \"no right to establish a sphere of influence to try to control their neighbours\".[97] NATO underlined that it is a defensive alliance, and it had co-operated with Russia until the latter annexed Crimea.[96] It offered to improve communication with Russia, and negotiate limits on missile placements and military exercises, as long as Russia withdrew troops from Ukraine's borders,[98] but Russia did not."

Putin told him that Ukraine should not be an independent state.[101] Scholz told Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to declare Ukraine a neutral country and renounce its aspirations to join NATO. Zelenskyy replied that Putin could not be trusted, as he had broken agreements.[102] Ukraine had been a neutral country in 2014 when Russia occupied Crimea and invaded the Donbas.[65][103] On 19 February, Zelenskyy made a speech at the Munich Security Conference, calling for Western powers to end their \"appeasement\" towards Putin and give a clear time-frame for when Ukraine could join NATO.[104] Analysts Taras Kuzio and Vladimir Socor agree that \"when Russia made its decision to invade Ukraine, that country was more remote than ever not only from NATO membership but from any track that might lead to membership\".[93]"

The Ukrainian military announced plans for a large-scale guerrilla campaign to complement its conventional defence.[433]"

In response, Russian forces began destroying mobile phone network equipment, searching door-to-door for smartphones and computers, and in at least one case killed a civilian who had pictures of Russian tanks.[437]"

Ukrainian authorities estimate that nearly 20,000 Ukrainian children have been forcibly taken from occupied territories to Russia since the full-scale invasion began. Wayne Jordash, president of humanitarian law firm Global Rights Compliance, described forcibly transferring or deporting children as war crimes, adding that when done as part of a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population, Russia is also committing crimes against humanity.[620][621]"

ISW cited Kremlin documents uncovered by Ukrainian human rights activists dated 18 February 2022, describing plans to move Ukrainian children from orphanages in occupied Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts to Russia under ″humanitarian evacuations″, particularly planning to target vulnerable children without parental care. In the years following the invasion, Russia has embarked on a deeply institutionalised project to abduct and forcibly give Ukrainian children a Russian identity. International law explicitly forbids this kind of forcible transfer of children, and holds moving children for the purpose of damaging a national or ethnic group to be an act of genocide.[622]"

He explained: \"I just came from a Raconteurs tour and went right into that, so I was already full-speed. Meg had come from a dead-halt for a year and went right back into that madness.\"[70]"

Debris fell into the venue and onto concertgoers, burying several people.

One concertgoer was pronounced dead at the scene; 48 more were injured, of whom 27 were taken to hospitals by ambulance. The structure's facade and upper roof were thrown into the street."

    "content": "The Gaza war[o] is an armed conflict in the Gaza Strip and Israel that has been fought since 7 October 2023, as part of the unresolved Israeli–Palestinian and Gaza–Israel conflicts dating back to the 20th century. On 7 October 2023, Hamas-led militant groups launched a surprise attack on Israel, in which 1,195 Israelis and foreign nationals, including 815 civilians, were killed, and 251 taken hostage with the stated goal of forcing Israel to release Palestinian prisoners. Since the start of the Israeli offensive that followed, over 61,000 Palestinians in Gaza have been killed,[p] almost half of them women and children, and more than 150,000 injured.[79][80][18] A study in The Lancet estimated 64,260 deaths in Gaza from traumatic injuries by June 2024, while noting a potentially larger death toll when \"indirect\" deaths are included.[14][81][82][83] As of May 2025, a comparable figure for traumatic injury deaths would be 93,000.[84]"

Israeli forces launched numerous campaigns during the invasion, including the Rafah offensive from May 2024, three battles fought around Khan Yunis, and the siege of North Gaza from October 2024, and have assassinated Hamas leaders inside and outside of Gaza. A temporary ceasefire in November 2023 broke down, and a second ceasefire in January 2025 ended with a surprise attack by Israel in March 2025."

The Israel Defense Forces violently suppressed the protests, killing hundreds and injuring thousands of Palestinians by sniper fire.[141][142] Soon after a short 2021 conflict occurred, Hamas's military wing, the Al-Qassam Brigades, started planning an operation against Israel, which became the 7 October attacks.[143][144] According to diplomats, Hamas had repeatedly said in the months leading up to October 2023 that it did not want another military escalation in Gaza as it would worsen the humanitarian crisis that occurred after the 2021 conflict.[134]"

These actions have been criticized as having backfired in light of the attacks on 7 October 2023.[158][159][160] US President Joe Biden has said the aim of the 7 October attacks was to disrupt the Saudi–Israel normalization talks.[161]"

Israel and Hamas blamed each other for the attack.[219] The IDF said Hamas set up roadblocks to keep Gaza residents from evacuating.[220] Israeli officials, foreign governments and intergovernmental organizations condemned Hamas's alleged use of hospitals and civilians as human shields, which has been contested by Amnesty International[221] and by Hamas themselves.[222][223]"

It can be fresh and fruity, but does not keep long. Also known as ugni blanc, it has many other names reflecting a family of local subtypes, particularly in Italy and France.[2] Its high acidity makes it important in Cognac and Armagnac[3] productions."

It is therefore possible that Garganega is one of the parents of Trebbiano; however, since the parents of Garganega have not been identified, the exact nature of the relationship could not be conclusively established.[5] Also, in the early 21st century, DNA analysis has suggested that there may be a close genetic relationship between Trebbiano and the Emilia-Romagna wine grape Alionza.[6]"

During the Spring and Autumn period, China's feudal fengjian system became largely irrelevant. The Zhou court, having lost its homeland in the Guanzhong region, held nominal power, but had real control over only a small royal demesne centered on Luoyi. During the early part of the Zhou dynasty period, royal relatives and generals had been given control over fiefdoms in an effort to maintain Zhou authority over vast territory.[11] As the power of the Zhou kings waned, these fiefdoms became increasingly independent states."

    "content": "After the Zhou capital was sacked by the Marquess of Shen and the Quanrong barbarians, the Zhou moved the capital east from the now desolated Zongzhou in Haojing near modern Xi'an to Wangcheng in the Yellow River Valley[c].  The Zhou royalty was then closer to its main supporters,[12] particularly Jin, and Zheng;[13][14] the Zhou royal family had much weaker authority and relied on lords from these vassal states for protection, especially during their flight to the eastern capital.  In Chengzhou, Prince Yijiu was crowned by his supporters as King Ping.[14]  However, with the Zhou domain greatly reduced to Chengzhou and nearby areas, the court could no longer support the six army groups it had in the past; Zhou kings had to request help from powerful vassal states for protection from raids and for resolution of internal power struggles.  The Zhou court would never regain its original authority; instead, it was relegated to being merely a figurehead of the regional states and ritual leader of the Ji clan ancestral temple. Though the king retained the Mandate of Heaven, the title held little actual power."

This political framework retained the fēngjiàn power structure, though interstate and intrastate conflict often led to declining regard for clan customs, respect for the Ji family, and solidarity with other Zhou peoples.[20]  The king's prestige legitimized the military leaders of the states, and helped mobilize collective defense of Zhou territory against \"barbarians\".[21]"

The role of subsequent hegemons would also be framed in this way: as the primary defender and supporter of nominal Zhou authority and the existing order. Using this authority, during the first eleven years of his hegemony, Duke Huan intervened in a power struggle in Lu; protected Yan from encroaching Western Rong nomads; drove off Northern Di nomads after their invasions of Wey and Xing, providing the people with provisions and protective garrison units; and led an alliance of eight states to conquer Cai and thereby block the northward expansion of Chu.[29]"

    "content": "Some version of the Five Classics existed in Spring and Autumn period, as characters in the Zuozhuan and Analects frequently quote the Book of Poetry and Book of Documents. On the other hand, the Zuozhuan depicts some characters actually composing poems that would later be included in the received text of the Book of Poetry.[which?] In the Analects there are frequent references to \"The Rites\",[48] but as Classical Chinese does not employ punctuation or any markup to distinguish book titles from regular nouns it is not possible to know if what is meant is the Etiquette and Ceremonial (known then as the Book of Rites) or just the concept of ritual in general. On the other hand, the existence of the Book of Changes is well-attested in the Zuozhuan, as multiple characters use it for divination and accurately quote the received text."

The transmitted versions of these works all derive from the versions edited by Liu Xin in the century following Sima Qian."

Whole lineage groups moved around under socioeconomic stress, border groups not associated with the Zhou culture gained in power and sophistication, and the geopolitical situation demanded increased contact and communication.[50]"

    "content": "Under this new regime, an emergent systematization of noble ranks took root. Where the Western Zhou had concerned itself with politics, the ancestral temples, and legitimacy, in the Eastern Zhou politics came to the fore.[51] Titles which had previously reflected lineage seniority took on purely political meanings. At the top of the bunch were Gong (公) and Hou (侯), favoured lineages of old with generally larger territories and greater resources and prestige at their disposal. The majority of rulers were of the middling but tiered grades Bo (伯) and Zi (子). The rulers of two polities maintained the title Nan (男). A 2012 survey found no difference in grade between Gong and Hou, or between Zi and Nan.[52] Meanwhile, a new class of lower-tier aristocrats formed: the Shi (士), gentlemen too distantly related to the great houses to be born into a life of wielding power, but still part of the elite culture, aiming at upward social mobility, typically through the vector of officialdom."

Spain were able to keep the ball high in and around England's area, but England defended through blocks. They then won possession but Lauren James failed to capitalise on the chance created; possession then became more equal. From the fifteenth minute, the game was played end-to-end; England had the next good chance, with Lauren Hemp forcing a good save from Coll. Spain won the ball from the corner and played intricate football before Mariona Caldentey sent it behind – a few minutes later, in the 25th minute, Caldentey evaded England defender Lucy Bronze in the box and scored from a header off an Ona Batlle cross to put Spain ahead. England immediately attempted to equalise, but Keira Walsh shot just wide; in return, Putellas tried to send the ball forward for Spain again, but again put it behind.[29][30]"

Spain defender Olga Carmona won the ball back from Russo, clearing it out. A minute later, Del Castillo had time with the ball but sent her powerful shot wide; returning up the other end, Kelly forced a strong save from Coll after being played in by Toone. Spain and England swapped attacks again before Putellas was replaced for Spain by Clàudia Pina and Russo for England by Michelle Agyemang. Within minutes, Pina had a shot, which was put behind by Hampton, and took two corners for Spain. She then took a free kick which found Carmona, who was dispossessed by England striker Agyemang. England then played another passing sequence which led to captain Leah Williamson sending the ball across the goalface, without anyone able to take a shot. Spain countered with a blocked shot from Caldentey and a weak corner, both sides then exchanging attacks until the 90th minute; Spain replaced their attack and retained possession for the majority of regular time stoppage time, without any good chances.[29][30]"

    "content": "The England team flew from Zurich to Southend-on-Sea on the afternoon of 28 July, landing at London Southend Airport; after the flight plans were announced, it became the most-tracked plane on Flightradar24, with fans gathering at the airport to welcome them. Their plane, sponsored by Nike, was called \"Air Force Nike\"; the brand had added custom livery to it referencing England's second Euro title. The flight was delayed by around two hours; upon landing, the plane was showered by water in a ceremony from the airport's fire engines. Following the airport reception, the team were taken on coaches to London for a reception at 10 Downing Street, the road journey along the A13 lasting another two hours. As the BBC was broadcasting their homecoming live, the delays led to gaps in coverage. The 10 Downing Street reception was hosted by Rayner and Stephanie Peacock, the minister for sport, as Starmer had travelled to Scotland to meet US President Donald Trump.[48][49][50] The Telegraph compared the squad's arrival at Downing Street to that of the 2005 men's Ashes winners, noting the footballers were less dishevelled but still disorganised. The players were noted for \"polite\" laughter and smiles at the garden party, where they presented Rayner and Peacock with a signed shirt. Wiegman had a video call with Starmer and gave a speech from a Downing Street lectern.[49][36]"

He was summoned to Gaul, appointed to the position of caesar (heir) and swiftly married so that a dynasty could be founded.

Constans was sent to Hispania to quash the revolt, but suffered a defeat and withdrew to Arelate (modern Arles). In 410, Constans was sent to Hispania with another army. Gerontius had strengthened his forces with barbarians and won a battle against Constans; the latter withdrew north and was defeated again and killed at Vienne early in 411.

Flavius Claudius Constantinus[15][16] was a common soldier and early in 407, possibly in February, his fellow soldiers acclaimed him as emperor;[15][17][18] by some accounts purely because his name recalled the earlier glories of his namesake.[16] Rebellion in Roman Britain was not unusual: the contemporary theologian Jerome described it as a province rich in usurpers.[19] It was on the periphery of the Empire and there was a common view that it was overlooked in terms of resources and patronage.[20] Such revolts were usually short-lived; Constantine was uncommon both in establishing a lasting power base and in successfully exporting his rebellion to the mainland.[21]"

Constantine then personally moved against Sarus, but was besieged in Valence.[33][34] After a week of siege another army, led by Gerontius and his fellow-general Edobichus and largely made up of freshly recruited Franks and Alamanni, arrived to relieve Valence.

Even with Sarus's withdrawal to Italy, the knowledge of the large new army assembling at Ticinum (modern Pavia) with the intention of shortly engaging Constantine encouraged them to persist and even to attempt to seal the Pyrenean passes.[37] Constantine feared that Honorius's cousins would organise an attack from that direction while troops under Sarus and Stilicho attacked him from Italy catching him in a pincer manoeuvre.

Stilicho got his way: he was to leave for the east and Honorius was to remain in Ravenna, the capital of the Western Empire.[42][43] But a rift between him and Honorius was obvious. Much of Honorius's court, led by the senior bureaucrat Olympius, worked to oppose Stilicho by spreading rumours that he wished to travel east to depose Theodosius and set his son, Eucherius, on the throne. On 13 August Honorius was formally reviewing the army about to set out from Ticinum against Constantine. With him were many of the senior officers and officials of the Western Empire. The troops mutinied, slaughtering Stilicho's supporters but respecting the person of the Emperor. Stilicho sought sanctuary, then surrendered and was executed on 22 August.[44]"

    "content": "In spring or summer 409 Constans was sent back to Hispania. Either before Constans left Arelate or while he was travelling, Gerontius rebelled and proclaimed his client Maximus emperor. Maximus was an important figure in his own right, but it was clear he was controlled by Gerontius.[33][51] They set up court at Tarraco (modern Tarragona). Gerontius, concerned that he would not be able to withstand the military force Constans could bring to bear, attempted to incite the barbarians who had entered Gaul late in 406 against Constantine. These had been quiescent in the north of the territory, but now set off across Gaul for the rich territories of Aquitaine and Narbonensis (modern southern and south-west France) which they devastated. Concentrating on the threat from Constans, Gerontius weakened his garrisons in the Pyrenean passes and in autumn 409 much of the barbarian force entered Hispania.[52][53] Eventually Gerontius reached an arrangement with some of these groups whereby they supplied him with military forces, which enabled him to take the offensive against Constans.[53]"

At about the same time Constantine returned from an abortive invasion of Italy. Given the difficulties the Visigoths were creating in Italy, Gerontius was considered a greater threat than Honorius.[54][55] Edobichus was again sent north to raise troops from the Franks while Constans returned to confront Gerontius with a fresh army. Details are again unclear, but it seems likely that Gerontius was simultaneously advancing on Arelate. The two armies clashed and Constans was defeated. He fell back to the north with what was left of his army, hoping to be reinforced by Edobichus. But Gerontius caught him at Vienne, probably early in 411, defeated his army and killed Constans. Gerontius's army then marched on Arelate and besieged Constantine.[56]"

    "content": "In 411 Honorius appointed a new general, Flavius Constantius, who took the army of Italy over the Alps and arrived at Arelate while Gerontius was outside the city. Many of Gerontius's troops deserted to Constantius and Gerontius withdrew to Hispania with the remainder. There, in a hopeless position, Gerontius committed suicide.[57][58] Constantius's army took over the siege. Meanwhile, Edobichus raised troops in northern Gaul among the Franks and Alamanni,[57] combined them with those of the army of Gaul still loyal to Constantine and marched to Constantine's assistance. Constantius defeated this force in an ambush.[59] After the troops guarding the Rhine abandoned him to support yet another claimant to the imperial throne – the Gallic Roman Jovinus – Constantine despaired, and he and his surviving son Julian surrendered to Constantius.[60] Despite the promise of his life, and his being ordained, Constantine and Julian were beheaded in either August or September 411 on Constantius's order.[15] Constantine's head was mounted on a pole and presented to Honorius on 18 September.[57] Constantius took over Stilicho's role as the main power in the Western Empire and generalissimo.[57] He was broadly able to recover the situation for the central authorities and to enable reconstruction. Gaul was pacified, the barbarians in Hispania were in large part subdued, the Visigoths were settled on land in Aquitaine as Roman allies.[61] Roman rule never returned to Britain after Constantine stripped its defences.[62]"

First constructed between 1695 and 1700 to host students and courses for William & Mary, it is the oldest college building in the United States.[9] Its original design, often attributed to the English Renaissance architect Sir Christopher Wren, was the largest yet constructed in the Chesapeake Colonies and marked a departure from medieval forms previously found in Colonial Virginia. The building has been partially rebuilt multiple times following damage by fires, a tornado, and battles. The present appearance of the Wren Building is a restoration of its early 18th-century form, completed as part of the Colonial Williamsburg projects."

Then known as the College Building, it was constructed by workers that included indentured servants and enslaved persons. A set of orations delivered at the building in 1699 convinced the colony's government to move from Jamestown to Middle Plantation, which was reestablished as the city of Williamsburg. The building hosted the government from 1700 to 1704, when the Capitol was completed. The first building was largely destroyed in a 1705 fire. A second building, utilizing surviving portions of the original structure, was constructed in 1715–1716. The southern chapel wing was completed in 1732, and Thomas Jefferson drafted plans for the unrealized fourth wing to the quadrangle in the 1770s."

It was 46 ft (14 m) deep and may have been of equal height to the cornice. The northern wing projected from the rear to form an ell. Its external dimensions were to a double-square plan at 64 ft (20 m) long and 32 ft (9.8 m) wide. The proportionality between the wings of 46:32 aligns with the golden ratio.[22] The brickwork of the 1695–1699 construction was done in the English bond pattern both above and below the water table.[23] The College Building's sash windows were the first in the colonies.[24][note 4]"

Perhaps to prevent the spread of fire, the stairs were positioned to the south of the central entry in a partitioned stair-hall. An \"Ingine for Quenching Fire\" was also requested from England.[35]"

The asymmetrical heights of the western and eastern walls meant six transverse hip roofs on the taller western side and a single three-sloped hip roof on the eastern side. Spotswood likely influenced the new cupola and pavilion. The cupola's height was reduced to a single story, with a weathervane mounted atop it. The main entrance was then set on the first floor, surrounded by a central two-story pavilion topped with a classically styled pediment. Among the only rooms attested to in contemporary writing was the large Blue Room, which was described as featuring blue paneling akin to that present in the Raleigh Tavern's Apollo Room.[36]"

This pulpit is thought to have been positioned in front of the communion table on the east–west axis. The congregational seating may have followed the English collegiate pattern of stalls facing inward with backs towards the walls.[41] There was probably a rail for the communion table, typical of nicer late-colonial Virginia parish churches.[42] The 1859 fire damaged the chapel and its contents.[43]"

Nicholson and Blair seized upon the opportunity to have the colony's capital removed to Middle Plantation and arranged for a May Day celebration held in 1699 at the College Building. On its steps, orations were given by five of the grammar school students. These orations communicated the benefits of Middle Plantation being made Virginia's new capital. Nicholson and Blair succeeded, with the colonial government approving the construction of a new statehouse in Middle Plantation, which they reestablished as the city of Williamsburg.[67] The College Building would host both the government and the college until the new Capitol was ready. The Governor's Council sat in the College Building first on October 17, 1700, and the House of Burgesses sat there first on December 5. With this arrangement leaving the building crowded, work began the same year on a lobby for the hall's western end.[68]"

He recorded events and wrote a description of the College Building. He also created the first depiction of the College Building and the only surviving depiction of the first building, showing its eastern façade. While archaeological work has determined his sketch of the wing being ten windows wide was incorrect –  with it now thought it was instead 13 windows wide –  it is a likely accurate albeit crude depiction of the façade.[69] That the first building was designed as a quadrangle is known from the only description of the structure published while it still stood, Robert Beverley Jr.'s 1705 The History and Present State of Virginia.[70]"

The first building was lost to a fire on the night of October 29, 1705, that nearly claimed the lives of several of the building's occupants.[72] A Governor's Council and House of Burgesses committee was established to investigate the fire but failed to formally determine a cause.[73]"

    "content": "Initial preparations for the second College Building began in 1709, a delay considered typical of the period. In March that year, Queen Anne granted ₤500 (equivalent to £85,779 in 2023) in quit-rent revenue towards construction. Other funding came from the salaries that would have been paid during the building's operations, with Blair also volunteering his income to support the construction. In the schoolhouse where the college had moved, debate among the college's administration ultimately favored reconstructing the building with the first one's surviving walls rather than erecting a new one. The building contract of ₤2,000 (equivalent to £343,114 in 2023) was awarded to John Tullitt on October 31, with wood to come from the college's land.[73] While the Anne's gift was sufficient to clear the burnt remains of the first building, the arrival of Alexander Spotswood in June 1710 as the new Virginia governor came with a warrant worth a further ₤500 towards the construction. Spotswood had an interest in architecture and took an active role in the building's completion.[74]"

Likely among Spotswood's contributions to the design were the pavilion emphasizing the eastern façade's front and the shorten cupola.[76] The construction of the Capitol and growth of Williamsburg along Duke of Gloucester Street meant that the college and its 18th-century construction would be oriented eastward, rather than the originally conceived westward expansion.[77]"

Classical architecture became nearly universal in England after 1660 with the work of Christopher Wren and his contemporaries, but the College Building and subsequent construction at Williamsburg are credited with bringing this style to Virginia.[81]"

Reps –  favored attributing the first building's to Wren, contending that the royal interest in the college and the social connections of its sponsors make Wren's involvement in such a project plausible. The American architectural historian William Pierson Jr. wrote in 1970 that, even though Wren's prestige would have likely precluded him from designing \"unimportance buildings on the fringes of the empire\", Jones would have been knowledgable on the matter and that Wren or an employee at Wren's Office of Works may have been involved in the initial designs for the first building. Pierson held that, if Wren or someone who worked for him did produce a design, the conditions in Virginia saw that design substantially modified. The British art historian Margaret Whinney, writing in 1971 and utilizing the Michel drawing, pointed to \"clumsy\" proportions in holding that any design by Wren would have been substantially altered, saying \"the adaptions of the Gentlemen in America were such that it bore little resemblance to his architecture\".[86]"

However, Whiffen believed it was possible Wren had provided a design for the first building that had been altered before construction. Whiffen, noting Blair's Scottish background, posited that the Scottish architects William Bruce and Robert Mylne were also plausible candidates for having been the first building's architect.[87] In 1968, Colonial Williamsburg historian Catherine Savedge Schlesinger suggested that both being mathematicians may have led to a misattribution, adding that \"Jones['s] book was intentionally slanted to 'sell' Virginia\". However, Schlesinger also believed it was unlikely that Jones would have intentionally fabricated the connection, as he was likely writing while Wren was still alive.[85][note 7]"

The British architectural historians Kerry Downes and John Harris expressed to Kornwolf their persistent skepticism towards the attribution in 1987–1988. The Colonial Williamsburg Foundation grew less supportive of Jones's attribution over the 20th century, with the foundation's then-architect Nicholas Papas saying in 1988 that he still dismissed Wren's direct involvement but that Kornwolf's work had convinced him that the Office of Works had submitted a design.[88]"

When more than fifty years pass in the oak barrel, the cognac's alcohol content decreases to 40% in volume.[11] The cognac is then transferred to \"large glass bottles called bonbonnes\", then stored for future \"blending.\"[11] Since oak barrels stop contributing to flavor after four or five decades, longer aging periods may not be beneficial.[11]"

    "content": "The age of the cognac is calculated as that of the youngest component used in the blend. The blend is usually of different ages and (in the case of the larger and more commercial producers) from different local areas. This blending, or marriage, of different eaux de vie is important to obtain a complexity of flavours absent from an eau de vie from a single distillery or vineyard. Each cognac house has a master taster (maître de chai), who is responsible for blending the spirits, so that cognac produced by a company will have a consistent house style and quality.[15] In this respect, it is similar to the process of blending whisky or non-vintage Champagne to achieve a consistent brand flavor. A very small number of producers, such as Guillon Painturaud and Moyet, do not blend their final product from different ages of eaux de vie, so produce a \"purer\" flavour.[16]\nHundreds of vineyards in the Cognac AOC region sell their own cognac. These are likewise blended from the eaux de vie of different years, but they are single-vineyard cognacs, varying slightly from year to year and according to the taste of the producer, hence lacking some of the predictability of the better-known commercial products. Depending on their success in marketing, small producers may sell a larger or smaller proportion of their product to individual buyers, wine dealers, bars and restaurants, the remainder being acquired by larger cognac houses for blending."

    "content": "Ian Lancaster Fleming (28 May 1908 – 12 August 1964) was a British writer, best known for his postwar James Bond series of spy novels. Fleming came from a wealthy family connected to the merchant bank Robert Fleming & Co., and his father was the Member of Parliament (MP) for Henley from 1910 until his death on the Western Front in 1917. Educated at Eton, Sandhurst, and, briefly, the universities of Munich and Geneva, Fleming moved through several jobs before he started writing."

    "content": "Fleming wrote his first Bond novel, Casino Royale, in 1952, at age 44. It was a success, and three print runs were commissioned to meet the demand. Eleven Bond novels and two collections of short stories followed between 1953 and 1966. The novels centre around James Bond, an officer in the Secret Intelligence Service, commonly known as MI6. Bond is also known by his code number, 007, and was a commander in the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve. The Bond stories rank among the best-selling series of fictional books of all time, having sold over 100 million copies worldwide. Fleming also wrote the children's story Chitty-Chitty-Bang-Bang (1964) and two works of non-fiction. In 2008, The Times ranked Fleming 14th on its list of \"The 50 greatest British writers since 1945\"."

Fleming was a heavy smoker and drinker for most of his life and succumbed to heart disease in 1964 at the age of 56. Two of his James Bond books were published posthumously; other writers have since produced Bond novels. Fleming's creation has appeared in film twenty-seven times, portrayed by six actors in the official film series."

V. Slater, who disapproved of Fleming's attitude, his hair oil, his ownership of a car and his relations with women.[14] Slater persuaded Fleming's mother to remove him from Eton a term early for a crammer course to gain entry to the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.[3][14] He spent less than a year there, leaving in 1927 without gaining a commission, after contracting gonorrhea.[16]"

He scored an adequate pass standard, but failed to get a job offer.[20] His mother intervened in his affairs, lobbying Sir Roderick Jones, head of Reuters News Agency, and in October 1931 he was given a position as a sub-editor and journalist for the company.[1] In April 1933 Fleming spent time in Moscow, where he covered the Stalinist show trial of six engineers from the British company Metropolitan-Vickers,[21] generally known as the Metro-Vickers Affair. While there he applied for an interview with Soviet premier Joseph Stalin, and was amazed to receive a personally signed note apologising for not being able to attend.[22] Upon returning from Moscow he ended the engagement to Monique after his mother threatened to cut off his trust fund allowance.[23][24][25][26]"

After her death during a World War II bombing raid in London in 1944,[28] Fleming was overcome with guilt and remorse, and it is generally thought that she provided the inspiration for the women he was to create for his future novels.[29][30] Early in 1939 Fleming began an affair with Ann O'Neill, née Charteris, who was married to the 3rd Baron O'Neill;[31] she was also having an affair with Esmond Harmsworth, the heir to Lord Rothermere, owner of the Daily Mail.[32]"

I understand there is no difficulty in obtaining corpses at the Naval Hospital, but, of course, it would have to be a fresh one.\"[40]"

The crew would then attack their German rescuers and bring their boat and Enigma machine back to England.[42] Much to the annoyance of Alan Turing and Peter Twinn at Bletchley Park, the mission was never carried out. According to Fleming's niece, Lucy, an official of the Royal Air Force pointed out that if they were to drop a downed Heinkel bomber in the English Channel, it would probably sink rather quickly.[43]"

This wasted the men's specialist skills, risked their safety on operations that did not justify the use of such skilled operatives, and threatened the vital gathering of intelligence. Afterwards, the management of these units was revised.[55] He also followed the unit into Germany after it located, in Tambach Castle, the German naval archives from 1870.[59]"

At first, they were unenthusiastic about the novel, but Fleming's brother Peter, whose books they managed, persuaded the company to publish it.[87] On 13 April 1953 Casino Royale was released in the UK in hardcover, priced at 10s 6d,[88] with a cover designed by Fleming.[89] It was a success and three print runs were needed to cope with the demand.[88][89][90]"

Bond is also known by his code number, 007, and was a commander in the Royal Naval Reserve. Fleming took the name for his character from that of the American ornithologist James Bond, an expert on Caribbean birds and author of the definitive field guide Birds of the West Indies. Fleming, himself a keen birdwatcher,[91] had a copy of Bond's guide, and later told the ornithologist's wife, \"that this brief, unromantic, Anglo-Saxon and yet very masculine name was just what I needed, and so a second James Bond was born\".[92] In a 1962 interview in The New Yorker, he further explained: \"When I wrote the first one in 1953, I wanted Bond to be an extremely dull, uninteresting man to whom things happened; I wanted him to be a blunt instrument ... when I was casting around for a name for my protagonist I thought by God, [James Bond] is the dullest name I ever heard.\"[93]"

Soviet assassins already on the train drugged the conductor, and Karp's body was found shortly afterwards in a railway tunnel south of Salzburg.[104]"

Fleming was acutely aware of the loss of British prestige in the 1950s and early 60s, particularly during the Indonesia–Malaysia confrontation, when he had Tanaka accuse Britain of throwing away the empire \"with both hands\".[177][178][179]"

    "content": "A theme throughout the series was the effect of the Second World War.[189] The Times journalist Ben Macintyre considers that Bond was \"the ideal antidote to Britain's postwar austerity, rationing and the looming premonition of lost power\",[190] at a time when coal and many items of food were still rationed.[100] Fleming often used the war as a signal to establish good or evil in characters:[106][191] in For Your Eyes Only, the villain, Hammerstein, is a former Gestapo officer, while the sympathetic Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer, Colonel Johns, served with the British under Montgomery in the Eighth Army.[192] Similarly, in Moonraker, Drax (Graf Hugo von der Drache) is a \"megalomaniac German Nazi who masquerades as an English gentleman\",[193] and his assistant, Krebs, bears the same name as Hitler's last Chief of Staff.[106] In this, Fleming \"exploits another British cultural antipathy of the 1950s. Germans, in the wake of the Second World War, made another easy and obvious target for bad press.\"[193] As the series progressed, the threat of a re-emergent Germany was overtaken by concerns about the Cold War, and the novels changed their focus accordingly.[194]"

    "content": "Distillation can operate over a wide range of pressures from 0.14 bar (e.g., ethylbenzene/styrene) to nearly 21 bar (e.g.,propylene/propane) and is capable of separating feeds with high volumetric flowrates and various components that cover a range of relative volatilities from only 1.17 (o-xylene/m-xylene) to 81.2 (water/ethylene glycol).[2] Distillation provides a convenient and time-tested solution to separate a diversity of chemicals in a continuous manner with high purity. However, distillation has an enormous environmental footprint, resulting in the consumption of approximately 25% of all industrial energy use.[3] The key issue is that distillation operates based on phase changes, and this separation mechanism requires vast energy inputs."

The term dry distillation includes the separation processes of destructive distillation and of chemical cracking, breaking down large hydrocarbon molecules into smaller hydrocarbon molecules. Moreover, a partial distillation results in partial separations of the mixture's components, which process yields nearly-pure components; partial distillation also realizes partial separations of the mixture to increase the concentrations of selected components. In either method, the separation process of distillation exploits the differences in the relative volatility of the component substances of the heated mixture."

Both alembics and retorts are forms of glassware with long necks pointing to the side at a downward angle to act as air-cooled condensers to condense the distillate and let it drip downward for collection. Later, copper alembics were invented. Riveted joints were often kept tight by using various mixtures, for instance a dough made of rye flour.[34] These alembics often featured a cooling system around the beak, using cold water, for instance, which made the condensation of alcohol more efficient. These were called pot stills. Today, the retorts and pot stills have been largely supplanted by more efficient distillation methods in most industrial processes. However, the pot still is still widely used for the elaboration of some fine alcohols, such as cognac, Scotch whisky, Irish whiskey, tequila, rum, cachaça, and some vodkas. Pot stills made of various materials (wood, clay, stainless steel) are also used by bootleggers in various countries. Small pot stills are also sold for use in the domestic production[35] of flower water or essential oils."

In batch distillation, a still is charged (supplied) with a batch of feed mixture, which is then separated into its component fractions, which are collected sequentially from most volatile to less volatile, with the bottoms – remaining least or non-volatile fraction – removed at the end.

At boiling point, all volatile components boil, but for a component, its percentage in the vapor is the same as its percentage of the total vapor pressure. Lighter components have a higher partial pressure and, thus, are concentrated in the vapor, but heavier volatile components also have a (smaller) partial pressure and necessarily vaporize also, albeit at a lower concentration in the vapor. Indeed, batch distillation and fractionation succeed by varying the composition of the mixture. In batch distillation, the batch vaporizes, which changes its composition; in fractionation, liquid higher in the fractionation column contains more lights and boils at lower temperatures. Therefore, starting from a given mixture, it appears to have a boiling range instead of a boiling point, although this is because its composition changes: each intermediate mixture has its own, singular boiling point."

    "type": "text",
    "content": "Continuous distillation differs from batch distillation in the respect that concentrations should not change over time. Continuous distillation can be run at a steady state for an arbitrary amount of time. For any source material of specific composition, the main variables that affect the purity of products in continuous distillation are the reflux ratio and the number of theoretical equilibrium stages, in practice determined by the number of trays or the height of packing. Reflux is a flow from the condenser back to the column, which generates a recycle that allows a better separation with a given number of trays. Equilibrium stages are ideal steps where compositions achieve vapor–liquid equilibrium, repeating the separation process and allowing better separation given a reflux ratio. A column with a high reflux ratio may have fewer stages, but it refluxes a large amount of liquid, giving a wide column with a large holdup. Conversely, a column with a low reflux ratio must have a large number of stages, thus requiring a taller column."

The column can even consist of small subsystems ('trays' or 'dishes') which all contain an enriched, boiling liquid mixture, all with their own vapor–liquid equilibrium."

Alternatively, a vacuum pump may be used to keep the apparatus at a lower than atmospheric pressure.  If the substances involved are air- or moisture-sensitive, the connection to the atmosphere can be made through one or more drying tubes packed with materials that scavenge the undesired air components, or through bubblers that provide a movable liquid barrier.  Finally, the entry of undesired air components can be prevented by pumping a low but steady flow of suitable inert gas, like nitrogen, into the apparatus."

The gaseous phase no longer exerts significant pressure on the substance to be evaporated, and consequently, rate of evaporation no longer depends on pressure. That is, because the continuum assumptions of fluid dynamics no longer apply, mass transport is governed by molecular dynamics rather than fluid dynamics. Thus, a short path between the hot surface and the cold surface is necessary, typically by suspending a hot plate covered with a film of feed next to a cold plate with a line of sight in between. Molecular distillation is used industrially for purification of oils."

This technique is often used for compounds which are unstable at high temperatures or to purify small amounts of compound. The advantage is that the heating temperature can be considerably lower (at reduced pressure) than the boiling point of the liquid at standard pressure, and the distillate only has to travel a short distance before condensing. A short path ensures that little compound is lost on the sides of the apparatus."

The process is worked in theory. When zone heater is moving from the top to the bottom of the container then solid condensate with irregular impurity distribution is forming. Then most pure part of the condensate may be extracted as product. The process may be iterated many times by moving (without turnover) the received condensate to the bottom part of the container on the place of refined matter. The irregular impurity distribution in the condensate (that is efficiency of purification) increases with the number of iterations.\nZone distillation is the distillation analog of zone recrystallization. Impurity distribution in the condensate is described by known equations of zone recrystallization – with the replacement of the distribution co-efficient k of crystallization - for the separation factor α of distillation.[44][45][46]"

Given a simple, binary component feed, analytical methods such as the McCabe–Thiele method[41][50] or the Fenske equation[41] can be used. For a multi-component feed, simulation models are used both for design and operation. Moreover, the efficiencies of the vapor–liquid contact devices (referred to as \"plates\" or \"trays\") used in distillation towers are typically lower than that of a theoretical 100% efficient equilibrium stage. Hence, a distillation tower needs more trays than the number of theoretical vapor–liquid equilibrium stages. A variety of models have been postulated to estimate tray efficiencies."

Other factors that favor packing are: vacuum systems, smaller diameter columns, corrosive systems, systems prone to foaming, systems requiring low liquid holdup, and batch distillation. Conversely, factors that favor plate columns are: presence of solids in feed, high liquid rates, large column diameters, complex columns, columns with wide feed composition variation, columns with a chemical reaction, absorption columns, columns limited by foundation weight tolerance, low liquid rate, large turn-down ratio and those processes subject to process surges."

    "content": "This packing material can either be random or dumped packing (25–76 millimetres (1–3 in) wide) such as Raschig rings or structured sheet metal. Liquids tend to wet the surface of the packing and the vapors pass across this wetted surface, where mass transfer takes place. Unlike conventional tray distillation in which every tray represents a separate point of vapor–liquid equilibrium, the vapor–liquid equilibrium curve in a packed column is continuous. However, when modeling packed columns, it is useful to compute a number of \"theoretical stages\" to denote the separation efficiency of the packed column with respect to more traditional trays. Differently shaped packings have different surface areas and void space between packings. Both these factors affect packing performance."

    "content": "Another factor in addition to the packing shape and surface area that affects the performance of random or structured packing is the liquid and vapor distribution entering the packed bed. The number of theoretical stages required to make a given separation is calculated using a specific vapor to liquid ratio. If the liquid and vapor are not evenly distributed across the superficial tower area as it enters the packed bed, the liquid to vapor ratio will not be correct in the packed bed and the required separation will not be achieved. The packing will appear to not be working properly. The height equivalent to a theoretical plate (HETP) will be greater than expected. The problem is not the packing itself but the mal-distribution of the fluids entering the packed bed. Liquid mal-distribution is more frequently the problem than vapor. The design of the liquid distributors used to introduce the feed and reflux to a packed bed is critical to making the packing perform to it maximum efficiency. Methods of evaluating the effectiveness of a liquid distributor to evenly distribute the liquid entering a packed bed can be found in references.[52][53] Considerable work has been done on this topic by Fractionation Research, Inc. (commonly known as FRI).[54]"

Main areas of conflict included Europe and the Middle East, as well as parts of Africa and the Asia-Pacific. There were important developments in weaponry including tanks, aircraft, artillery, machine guns, and chemical weapons. One of the deadliest conflicts in history, it resulted in an estimated 30 million military casualties, plus another 8 million civilian deaths from war-related causes and genocide.

Growing tensions between the great powers and in the Balkans reached a breaking point on 28 June 1914, when Gavrilo Princip, a Bosnian Serb, assassinated the heir to the Austro-Hungarian throne. Austria-Hungary blamed Serbia, and declared war on 28 July. After Russia mobilised in Serbia's defence, Germany declared war on Russia and France, who had an alliance. The United Kingdom entered after Germany invaded Belgium, and the Ottomans joined the Central Powers in November. Germany's strategy in 1914 was to quickly defeat France then transfer its forces to the east, but its advance was halted in September, and by the end of the year the Western Front consisted of a near-continuous line of trenches from the English Channel to Switzerland. The Eastern Front was more dynamic, but neither side gained a decisive advantage, despite costly offensives. Italy, Bulgaria, Romania, Greece and others entered the war from 1915 onward."

Later that year, the Bolsheviks seized power in Russia in the October Revolution; Soviet Russia signed an armistice with the Central Powers in December, followed by a separate peace in March 1918. That month, Germany launched a spring offensive in the west, which despite initial successes left the German Army exhausted and demoralised. The Allied Hundred Days Offensive, beginning in August 1918, caused a collapse of the German front line. Following the Vardar Offensive, Bulgaria signed an armistice in late September. By early November, the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary had each signed armistices with the Allies, leaving Germany isolated. Facing a revolution at home, Kaiser Wilhelm II abdicated on 9 November, and the war ended with the Armistice of 11 November 1918."

Economic reforms led to a significant post-1908 expansion of railways and transportation infrastructure, particularly in its western border regions.[18] Since Germany and Austria-Hungary relied on faster mobilisation to compensate for their numerical inferiority compared to Russia, the threat posed by the closing of this gap was more important than competing with the Royal Navy. After Germany expanded its standing army by 170,000 troops in 1913, France extended compulsory military service from two to three years, sparking similar measures from the Balkan powers, Italy, the Ottoman Empire and Austria-Hungary. Absolute figures are difficult to calculate due to differences in categorising expenditure since they often omit civilian infrastructure projects like railways which had logistical importance and military use. However, from 1908 to 1913, military spending by the six major European powers increased by over 50% in real terms.[19]"

To avoid violating Belgian neutrality, he was told any advance could come only after a German invasion.[56] Instead, the French cabinet ordered its Army to withdraw 10 km behind the German frontier, to avoid provoking war. On 2 August, Germany occupied Luxembourg and exchanged fire with French units when German patrols entered French territory; on 3 August, they declared war on France and demanded free passage across Belgium, which was refused. Early on the morning of 4 August, the Germans invaded, and Albert I of Belgium called for assistance under the Treaty of London.[57][58] Britain sent Germany an ultimatum demanding they withdraw from Belgium; when this expired at midnight, without a response, the two empires were at war.[59]"

By keeping his left-wing deliberately weak, he hoped to lure the French into an offensive into the \"lost provinces\" of Alsace-Lorraine, which was the strategy envisaged by their Plan XVII.[65] However, Moltke grew concerned that the French might push too hard on his left flank and as the German Army increased in size from 1908 to 1914, he changed the allocation of forces between the two wings to 70:30.[66] He also considered Dutch neutrality essential for German trade and cancelled the incursion into the Netherlands, which meant any delays in Belgium threatened the viability of the plan.[67] Historian Richard Holmes argues that these changes meant the right wing was not strong enough to achieve decisive success.[68]"

Both armies were then so exhausted that no decisive move could be implemented, so they settled in trenches, with the vain hope of breaking through as soon as they could build local superiority."

By the end of 1914, the opposing forces confronted each other along an uninterrupted line of entrenched positions from the Channel to the Swiss border.[85] Since the Germans were normally able to choose where to stand, they generally held the high ground, while their trenches tended to be better built; those constructed by the French and English were initially considered \"temporary\", only needed until an offensive would destroy the German defences.[86] Both sides tried to break the stalemate using scientific and technological advances. On 22 April 1915, at the Second Battle of Ypres, the Germans (violating the Hague Convention) used chlorine gas for the first time on the Western Front. Several types of gas soon became widely used by both sides and though it never proved a decisive, battle-winning weapon, it became one of the most feared and best-remembered horrors of the war.[87][88]"

Convoys slowed the flow of supplies since ships had to wait as convoys were assembled; the solution was an extensive program of building new freighters.

Serbia was conquered in a little more than a month, as the Central Powers, now including Bulgaria, sent in 600,000 troops in total. The Serbian army, fighting on two fronts and facing certain defeat, retreated into northern Albania. The Serbs suffered defeat in the Battle of Kosovo. Montenegro covered the Serbian retreat toward the Adriatic coast in the Battle of Mojkovac on 6–7 January 1916, but ultimately the Austrians also conquered Montenegro. The surviving Serbian soldiers were evacuated to Greece.[108] After the conquest, Serbia was divided between Austro-Hungary and Bulgaria.[109]"

These issues were exacerbated by unimaginative strategies and tactics.[135] Between 1915 and 1917, the Italian commander, Luigi Cadorna, undertook a series of frontal assaults along the Isonzo, which made little progress and cost many lives; by the end of the war, Italian combat deaths totalled around 548,000.[136]"

    "content": "Despite his conviction that Germany must be defeated, Wilson went to war to ensure the US played a leading role in shaping the peace, which meant preserving the AEF as a separate military force, rather than being absorbed into British or French units as his Allies wanted.[171] He was strongly supported by AEF commander General John J. Pershing, a proponent of pre-1914 \"open warfare\" who considered the French and British emphasis on artillery misguided and incompatible with American \"offensive spirit\".[172] Much to the frustration of his Allies, who had suffered heavy losses in 1917, he insisted on retaining control of American troops, and refused to commit them to the front line until able to operate as independent units. As a result, the first significant US involvement was the Meuse–Argonne offensive in late September 1918.[173]"

Nivelle persisted with frontal assaults and, by 25 April, the French had suffered nearly 135,000 casualties, including 30,000 dead, most incurred in the first two days.[175]"

    "content": "In December 1917, the Central Powers signed an armistice with Russia, thus freeing large numbers of German troops for use in the West. With German reinforcements and new American troops pouring in, the outcome was to be decided on the Western Front. The Central Powers knew that they could not win a protracted war, but they held high hopes for success in a final quick offensive.[190] Ludendorff drew up plans (Operation Michael) for the 1918 offensive on the Western Front. The operation commenced on 21 March 1918, with an attack on British forces near Saint-Quentin. German forces achieved an unprecedented advance of 60 kilometres (37 mi).[191] The initial offensive was a success; after heavy fighting, however, the offensive was halted. Lacking tanks or motorised artillery, the Germans were unable to consolidate their gains. The problems of re-supply were also exacerbated by increasing distances that now stretched over terrain that was shell-torn and often impassable to traffic.[192]\nGermany launched Operation Georgette against the northern English Channel ports. The Allies halted the drive after limited territorial gains by Germany. The German Army to the south then conducted Operations Blücher and Yorck, pushing broadly towards Paris. Germany launched Operation Marne (Second Battle of the Marne) on 15 July, in an attempt to encircle Reims. The resulting counter-attack, which started the Hundred Days Offensive on 8 August,[193] led to a marked collapse in German morale.[194][195][196]"

The Spanish flu killed at least 17 to 25 million people,[251][252] including an estimated 2.64 million Europeans and as many as 675,000 Americans.[253] Between 1915 and 1926, an epidemic of encephalitis lethargica affected nearly 5 million people worldwide.[254][255]"

The Armenians were intentionally marched to death and a number were attacked by Ottoman brigands.[264] While the exact number of deaths is unknown, the International Association of Genocide Scholars estimates around 1.5 million.[262][265] The government of Turkey continues to deny the genocide to the present day, arguing that those who died were victims of inter-ethnic fighting, famine, or disease during World War I; these claims are rejected by most historians.[266]"

President Wilson was on the verge of cutting off the loans in late 1916 but allowed a great increase in US government lending to the Allies. After 1919, the US demanded repayment of these loans. The repayments were, in part, funded by German reparations that, in turn, were supported by American loans to Germany. This circular system collapsed in 1931 and some loans were never repaid. Britain still owed the United States $4.4 billion[h] of World War I debt in 1934; the last installment was finally paid in 2015.[285]"

However, neither of them interpreted it as an admission of war guilt.[288] In 1921, the total reparation sum was placed at 132 billion gold marks. However, \"Allied experts knew that Germany could not pay\" this sum. The total sum was divided into three categories, with the third being \"deliberately designed to be chimerical\" and its \"primary function was to mislead public opinion ... into believing the 'total sum was being maintained.'\"[289] Thus, 50 billion gold marks (12.5 billion dollars) \"represented the actual Allied assessment of German capacity to pay\" and \"therefore ... represented the total German reparations\" figure that had to be paid.[289]"

The bonds, the agreement, still exist.\" Thus, following the Second World War, at the London Conference in 1953, Germany agreed to resume payment on the money borrowed.

In addition, multiple peace proposals were coming from neutrals, or one side or the other; none of them progressed very far.[329][330][page needed][331][page needed]"

Teaching World War I has presented special challenges. When compared with World War II, the First World War is often thought to be \"a wrong war fought for the wrong reasons\"; it lacks the metanarrative of good versus evil that characterises retellings of the Second World War. Lacking recognizable heroes and villains, it is often taught thematically, invoking simplified tropes that obscure the complexity of the conflict.[341]"

Some sources also report an additional forename, Jindan, after her paternal grandmother, Maharani Jind Kaur.[10][11] Becauce of the family's complex history, the India Office kept them under surveillance in case they became involved in any political activity around India.[4]"

During the visit, all the while shadowed by British agents, she encountered Indian independence activists such as Gopal Krishna Gokhale and Lala Lajpat Rai and expressed sympathy for their cause.[5][8] Singh admired Rai, and his imprisonment by the authorities on \"charges of sedition\" turned Sophia against the British Raj.[5]"

She protested that she should not have to pay the licence fees without the right to vote.[16] That July a bailiff went to Singh's house to collect an unpaid fine of 14 shillings, which she refused to pay. Her diamond ring was then confiscated by the police and auctioned a few days later; a friend bought it and returned it to her.[16] In December 1913, Singh was fined £12/10s for refusing to pay licence fees for two dogs, a carriage and a servant.[27][25] On 13 December 1913 she and other WTRL members appeared in court and Singh was again accused of keeping dogs without a licence. Singh tried to fall in front of Prime Minister H. H. Asquith's car while holding a poster reading, \"Give women the vote!\" She supported the manufacture of bombs, encouraging anarchy in Britain.[16][26] Despite Singh's activism as a suffragette, she was never arrested; although her activities were watched by the administration, they may not have wanted to make a martyr of her.[7]"

He retired to the Cognac region, and began distilling and exporting brandies, first to Britain and his native Ireland, closely followed by the United States.[8] In 1813 Richard Hennessy's son James Hennessy gave the company its trading name, Jas Hennessy & Co.[9] He was also responsible for choosing Jean Fillioux as the house's Master Blender.

It was one of the first marques to sell bottles rather than casks of cognac, a process that helped it survive the Great French Wine Blight in the mid-nineteenth century.[5] It was also the first cognac house to use star ratings, and the gradings V.S.O.P. and XO, which are today used by most other cognac producers."

This is because these portions of the distillate may contain high concentrations of congeners (which it may be desirable to keep out of the final distillate for reasons of style, taste and toxicity). For example, the presence of pectin in the wash (e.g., due to using a mash made from fruit) may result in the production of methanol (a.k.a. wood alcohol), which has a lower boiling point than ethanol and thus would be more concentrated in the foreshots. Methanol is toxic and at sufficient concentrations, it can cause blindness and fatal kidney failure. It is especially important to discard the initial foreshots, while a small amount of the near-centre heads and tails are often included in the final product for their effect on the flavour.[11][12]"

Secondly, it limits the use of content whose author cannot be found.[24] Finally, it creates a perceived barrier between authors by limiting derivative works, such as mashups and collaborative content.[25] Although open content has been described as a counterbalance to copyright, open content licenses rely on a copyright holder's power to license their work, as copyleft which also utilizes copyright for such a purpose.[26]"

Unlike works in the public domain, the author still maintains copyright over the material, however, the author has granted a non-exclusive license to any person to distribute, and often modify, the work. Copyleft licenses require that any derivative works be distributed under the same terms and that the original copyright notices be maintained. A symbol commonly associated with copyleft is a reversal of the copyright symbol, facing the other way; the opening of the C points left rather than right. Unlike the copyright symbol, the copyleft symbol does not have a codified meaning.[29]"

Only a few countries have explicit licenses in their law-documents, as the UK's Open Government Licence (a CC BY compatible license). In the other countries, the implied license comes from its proper rules (general laws and rules about copyright in government works). The automatic protection provided by the Berne Convention does not apply to the texts of laws: Article 2.4 excludes the official texts from the automatic protection. It is also possible to \"inherit\" the license from context. The set of country's law-documents is made available through national repositories. Examples of law-document open repositories: LexML Brazil, Legislation.gov.uk, and N-Lex. In general, a law-document is offered in more than one (open) official version, but the main one is that published by a government gazette. So, law-documents can eventually inherit license expressed by the repository or by the gazette that contains it."

Its eastern coastline is the Bering Sea, part of the Pacific Ocean."

The increase in precipitation is due to prevailing westerly winds blowing over the Sea of Japan, which pick up moisture that rises as it hits the higher topography of the peninsula, and condenses into rain. The summers are moderately cool, and the winters are rather stormy; however, the storms rarely produce lightning."

The peaks of the highest mountains have an ice cap climate (EF). Kamchatka is much wetter and milder than eastern Siberia. It is essentially transitional from the hypercontinental climate of Siberia and northeast China to the rain-drenched subpolar oceanic climate of the Aleutian Islands."

In the heavily glaciated Kronotsky Peninsula, where maritime influences are most pronounced, annual precipitation can reach as high as 2,500 millimetres (98 in), whilst the southeast coast south of Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky generally receives around 1,166 millimetres (45.9 in) of rainfall equivalent per year. Considerable local variations exist: southern parts of the Petropavlovsk-Kamchatsky metropolitan area can receive as much as 430 millimetres (17 in) more than the northern part of the city. Temperatures here are very mild, with summer maxima around 16 °C (61 °F) and winter lows around −8 °C (18 °F), whilst diurnal temperature ranges seldom exceed 5 °C (9 °F) due to persistent fog on exposed parts of the coast. South of 57° ˚N, there is no permafrost due to the relatively mild winters and heavy snow cover, whilst northward, discontinuous permafrost prevails. The west coastal plain has a colder and drier climate with precipitation ranging from 880 millimetres (34.6 in) in the south to as little as 430 millimetres (17 in) in the north, where winter temperatures become considerably colder at around −20 °C (−4 °F)."

Consequently, Russians entered Kamchatka from the north. In 1651, after having assisted in the foundation of the Anadyrsk ostrog, the explorer Mikhail Stadukhin went south and followed the coast of the Sea of Okhotsk from Penzhina Bay to Okhotsk. From about 1667 there were reports of a Kamchatka River to the south. Some time before 1700, a group of Russians were stranded and died on Kamchatka."

Morozko got as far as the Tigil River and returned with reports and some mysterious writings, probably Japanese. In 1697–1699, Atlasov explored nearly the whole of the peninsula. He built an ostrog at Verkhny-Kamchatsk, rescued or captured a Japanese castaway, and went to Moscow to report. In 1699, the Russians at Verkhny-Kamchatsk were killed on their way back to Anadyrsk by the Koryaks. In 1700, a punitive expedition destroyed a Koryak village and founded Nizhne-Kamchatsk on the lower river. Bolskeretsk was founded in 1703. From about 1705, there was a breakdown of order. There were numerous mutinies and native wars all over the peninsula and north to the Koryak country of the Penzhina River and Olyutor Gulf. Several people were sent out to restore order, including Atlasov, who was murdered by mutineers in 1711. Vasily Merlin restored some degree of order between 1733 and 1739. There was no significant resistance after 1756. A major smallpox epidemic that hit in 1768–1769 quickly decimated the native population; the roughly 2,500 Itelmens present in 1773 were reduced to 1,900 in 1820, from an original population of 12,000–25,000. Those who survived adopted Russian customs, and there was a great deal of intermarriage, such that \"Kamchadal\" (the original Russian name for the Itelmens) came to mean any Russian or part-Russian born on the peninsula."

The variable climate promotes different flora zones where tundra and muskeg are dominant, succeeded by grasses, flowering shrubs, and forests of pine, birch, alder, and willow. The wide variety of plant forms spread throughout the Peninsula promotes a similar diversity in animal species that feed off the flora. Although Kamchatka is mostly tundra, deciduous and coniferous trees are abundant, and forests can be found throughout the peninsula."

This is due to many factors, including a wide range of climates; diverse topography and geography; many free-flowing rivers; proximity to the highly productive waters of the northwestern Pacific Ocean, the Bering, and the Okhotsk Seas; low human population density; and minimal development. The peninsula also boasts the southernmost expanse of Arctic tundra in the world. Nonetheless, commercial exploitation of marine resources and a history of fur trapping has taken its toll on several species."

In the Kronotsky Nature Reserve, there are estimated to be three to four bears per 100 square kilometres (39 sq mi).[23] Other fauna of note include carnivores such as Tundra wolf (Canis lupus albus), Arctic fox (Vulpes lagopus), Anadyr fox (Vulpes vulpes beringiana), East Siberian lynx (Lynx lynx wrangeli), wolverine (Gulo gulo), sable (Martes zibellina), Eurasian otter (Lutra lutra), East Siberian stoat (Mustela ermine kaneii), and Siberian least weasel (Mustela nivalis pygmaea). The peninsula hosts habitat for several large ungulates including the Kamchatka snow sheep, reindeer (Rangifer tarandus), and Chukotka moose (Alces alces buturlini), one of the largest moose in the world and the largest in Eurasia, and rodents/leporids, including mountain hare (Lepus timidus), marmot, and several species of lemming and squirrel. The peninsula is the breeding ground for Steller's Sea Eagle,[24] one of the largest eagle species, along with the Golden Eagle and Gyrfalcon."

Due to its uniquely suitable environment, biologists estimate that a fifth of all Pacific salmon originates in Kamchatka.[25] Kurile Lake is recognized as the biggest spawning-ground for sockeye in Eurasia.[26] In response to pressure from poaching and to worldwide decreases in salmon stocks, some 24,000 square kilometres (9,300 sq mi) along nine of the more productive salmon rivers are in the process of being set aside as a nature preserve. Stickleback species, particularly Gasterosteus aculeatus and Pungitius pungitius, also occur in many coastal drainages, and are likely present in freshwater as well."

Diederik and Johannes were direct descendants of the VOC soldier and later farmer, Matthys Andries de Beer, of Vaasa, Finland, who had migrated to South Africa in 1699 via Lübeck. Following the discovery of diamonds on Diederik and Johannes' land, the increasing demands of the British government forced them to sell their farm on 31 July 1871 to merchant Alfred Johnson Ebden (1820–1908) for £6,600. Vooruitzicht would become the site of the Big Hole and the De Beers mine, two successful diamond mines. Their name, which was given to one of the mines, subsequently became associated with the company.[14]"

By this time, the company was the sole owner of all diamond mining operations in South Africa.[19][22][23] In 1889, Rhodes negotiated a strategic agreement with the London-based Diamond Syndicate, which agreed to purchase a fixed quantity of diamonds at an agreed price, thereby regulating output and maintaining prices.[21][24] The agreement soon proved to be very successful – for example, during the trade slump of 1891–1892, supply was curtailed to maintain the price.[25] Rhodes was concerned about the break-up of the new monopoly, stating to shareholders in 1896 that the company's \"only risk is the sudden discovery of new mines, which human nature will work recklessly to the detriment of us all\".[21]"

Ernest Oppenheimer was appointed the local agent for the powerful London Syndicate, rising to the position of mayor of Kimberley within 10 years.

This inscription helps distinguish Forevermark diamonds from other natural diamonds though, similarly to when distinguishing natural diamonds from synthetic diamonds, it requires specialist detection equipment to view. The inscription also helps maintain scarcity: the Forevermark website boasts that only a tiny percentage of diamonds qualify for the Forevermark brand.[84]"

The report found significant evidence of profit shifting through volume and value manipulation.[125] Sharife simultaneously published an article[126] disclosing the political system that cultivated revenue leakage, including the donation of De Beers staff to the State Diamond Trader (SDT). The report, like the article, utilised aggregated data produced by the Kimberley Process (KP) certificates of import-exports, relying on figures listed by the diamond companies themselves, in which De Beers was the dominant player. The South African Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) disclosed that De Beers did not authorise them to publish figures involving values, sales, pricing and other data, preventing transparency of the industry.[citation needed]"

The city-state rolled out a high-publicity campaign which included being amongst the first to launch its official website, bid logo (despite IOC rules against bid logos) and a bid tagline \"Blazing the Trail\" on 16 October 2007.[3] It also got the local population to support its bid, including an effort by students to collect 1 million signatures.[4]"

A construction expert believed the US$423 million plan for an Olympic Village at the National University of Singapore (NUS) was feasible, and that the equestrian venue could be delivered on time.[6] In spite of the expert's findings, the Youth Olympic Village at the NUS's University Town did run into difficulties owing to increasing construction costs. It was subsequently decided that existing student halls of residence at Nanyang Technological University in Jurong West would be used for the Olympic Village.[7]"

The budget was later increased to U$284 million (S$387 million), thrice the original amount,[13] which the organisers attributed to major revisions in the scope and scale of the Games. Costs were increased for logistics and transport, security, and upgrades of various sports venues and technology. Financially, local companies received about 70%, or S$260 million, worth of contracts from the Games.[14] Concerns over cost overruns were dismissed by SYOGOC Chairman Ng Ser Miang.[15] The cost overruns was to become an issue that was raised by opposition parties during Singapore's 2011 general elections.[16]"

Designed to look like a lighthouse, its distinctive feature was a swirling 8 m (26 ft) column of fire dubbed the \"vortex flame\" or \"fire tornado\" inside a tube with an opening at the top end. Hot air that could reach 300 °C (572 °F) created around the flame rose, drawing cool air upwards from openings in the base of the tower. Just below the glass-panelled portion of the tower, the cool air was driven through angled guide vanes, thus creating the spiralling movement travelling upwards at 20 m/s (66 ft/s). The cauldron, which had been patented in Singapore and the United States, consumed about 2 MW (2,700 hp) of fuel, less than half the amount used by conventional Olympic cauldrons. Dr. Tsai said he hoped his design could be used for other Olympic events in future. The cauldron was secretly tested at 4:00 am during the two months leading up to the opening ceremony.[32]"

A contest to choose the official medal design for the first Youth Olympics was launched by the IOC in 2009. From November to December almost a hundred entries from 34 countries were received.

However, students usually did not stay for the full duration of sessions, which can be up to seven hours long.[60] The MOE denied that students were to blame, stating that more than 95% of students allocated tickets had attended events, and that some schools had asked to purchase additional tickets due to overwhelming demand.[61] The SYOGOC announced that once sessions had begun, unoccupied seats would be resold to people who turned up in person at venues.[60] To enable venue managers to gauge the number of seats available for resale, teachers escorting students to events were instructed to inform venue managers if they intended to leave before sessions ended and the number of seats occupied by students.[62] On 20 August, the organisers reported that tickets were sold out for all 26 sports except girls' football.[63]"

    "content": "Controversy also arose from the YOG attendance policy in Kuo Chuan Presbyterian Primary School, a local primary school. The school stated that a S$5 refundable deposit was required from students who attend the YOG events on a non-school day. The principal, Clifford Chua, said that it was to \"ensure that our children learn the value of responsibility and not take this rare opportunity for granted, by wasting the ticket and depriving others of the chance\". Also, the deposit was returned even if the child did not attend the event. However, the move garnered mixed reactions from parents, who either supported the idea or felt it was not the right way to do things. Some other schools such as Nanyang Girls High School, Bukit View Primary School and Park View Primary School gave free tickets to their students while Anglo-Chinese School (Primary) encouraged co-pay of $1 to $2 by the students to teach them to treasure their tickets.[64]"

    "content": "On 16 August 2010, Iranian officials withdrew Mohammed Soleimani from the men's under-48-kilogram category taekwondo final against Israel's Gili Haimovitz, citing an ankle injury. According to the officials, Soleimani had first hurt his ankle at the World Junior Championships in Mexico earlier in the year, and the injury had flared up again during his semifinal contest against the US's Gregory English. Soleimani was sent to hospital for an X-ray, and his ankle was put into a cast. Haimovitz was awarded the gold medal by default at a victory ceremony at the Suntec International Convention Centre from which Soleimani, the silver medallist, was absent. Interviewed later on, Soleimani said he was \"very sad\" to have missed the bout as he was \"sure [he] was going to get the gold medal\".[65] Israel's chef-de-mission Daniel Oren claimed that the pullout had been politically motivated. He said: \"It's not the first time this has happened at the Olympics. But this is a first for a medal match. To be honest, once our boy got into the final, we knew that this is going to happen. I spoke to our boy after the final and he, of course, was disappointed that he did not have a chance to win his gold through an actual fight. I feel more sorry for the Iranian boy. He must have trained hard to get to this stage and was not given a chance to fight. We are dealing with sports here, youth sports, in fact. It's a pity that politics got involved.\"[66] However, IOC spokesman Mark Adams said: \"As far as the IOC is concerned, there is no sinister intent here. What we know factually is that the athlete injured his ankle and was sent to the hospital for an X-ray. Tests revealed he did not suffer anything broken, and he is all right now. So unless more factual information is available, it [the controversy] is mere speculation.\"[65] This was reiterated by IOC President Jacques Rogge on 17 August: \"He [Soleimani] was driven to the hospital, was examined by a Singaporean doctor, totally independent, not belonging to the organisation and he diagnosed an ankle sprain. For us, that's the end of the story.\"[67] Previously, Iran has stated that since its existing government does not recognize Israel as a state, its policy is to withdraw from competing against the country.[68]"

He probably came from France, becoming prior and then the first abbot of the Temple, the reconstruction of which finished during his tenure. He became a confidant of King Fulk, Queen Melisende, and King Baldwin III. Because he spoke Greek, he was sent on sensitive diplomatic missions to Byzantine emperors in 1142 and 1158/9."

This is one of the few surviving examples of metrical poetry from the Latin East. Geoffrey appears to have refined certain stylistic weaknesses in the original, though the extent of his revisions is still debated. He also expanded the work with two additional books, which departed from the original’s fifteen-syllable metre and were instead composed in octosyllabic verse.[3] Geoffrey refers to this poem in a letter sent between November 1135 and late 1137 to King Fulk's son Count Geoffrey V of Anjou, whom he probably expected to donate money to the Temple.[4]"

A synod was held immediately after, attended (among others) by the catholicos of the Armenian Church and the Syriac Orthodox archbishop of Jerusalem. Hiestand assumes that Geoffrey was invited to the synod not just because of his rank but also because of his language skills.[5]"

In 1142 King Fulk sent him, along with Bishop Anselm of Bethlehem and Viscount Rohard the Elder of Jerusalem, to meet with Emperor John II Komnenos in northern Syria. John had expressed a wish to come to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage, but Fulk feared that the emperor wished to force him to pay homage and was not willing to cooperate. The envoys thus informed the emperor that the kingdom was not able to supply provisions for a large army and suggested that he come with only a modest escort. John indignantly rejected this condition, but treated the envoys well.[7] The matter was laid to rest when John was killed in a hunting accident the following winter.[7]"

It was an unofficial project as football was considered an unsuitable sport for women by both the Royal Spanish Football Federation and National Movement's Women's Section, which organized women's sports in Francoist Spain. When asked about the initiative in January 1971 RFEF president José Luis Pérez Payá answered \"I'm not against women's football, but I don't like it either. I don't think it's feminine from an aesthetic point of view. Women are not favored wearing shirts and shorts. Any regional dress would fit them better\".[8]"

On 15 July, with a 5-days delay for transfer issues, it played its first game abroad against Italy in Turin's Stadio Comunale, suffering an 8–1 defeat. It was then invited to the 2nd edition of unofficial women's world cup (Mundialito 1981), but RFEF forbid them to take part in the competition.[9] Despite these conditions Spain was entrusted hosting the 1972 World Cup. RFEF vetoed the project, and the competition was cancelled and disbanded. The unofficial Spanish team itself broke up shortly after."

The opponent was again Portugal, which defeated Spain 0–1. The team subsequently played 2-leg friendlies against France and Switzerland drawing with both opponents in Aranjuez and Barcelona and losing in Perpignan before it finally clinched its first victory in Zürich (0–1).[10] On 27 April 1985 it played its first official match in the 1987 European Championship's qualification, losing 1–0 against Hungary. After losing the first four matches Spain defeated Switzerland and drew with Italy to end third. The team also ended in its group's bottom positions in the subsequent 1989 and 1991 qualifiers. In 1988 Nieto was replaced as manager by Ignacio Quereda, who went on to coach the team for the next 27 years. Years later Nieto would confess (in the book El fútbol femenino en 20 toques by David Menayo): \"There was never love or support from the Federation towards those women football players\""

In the group stage of the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, however, their campaign ended up being a disaster. Spain managed only a 1–1 draw into the weakest team in the group, Costa Rica, before losing 0–1 to Brazil. In their last match with South Korea, they lost 1–2 after an initial lead, becoming the worst European team in the tournament. After the World Cup, the 23 players on the roster issued a collective statement for the end of Ignacio Quereda's reign as head coach.[13] Later that summer, Quereda stepped down and was replaced by Jorge Vilda, who had previously coached the U-19 team and was on the shortlist for the 2014 FIFA World Coach of the Year.[14][15]\nSpain qualified for the UEFA Women's Euro 2017 by winning all its matches and finishing 11 points ahead of the second-placed team.\nIn 2017 the national team participated for the first time in the Algarve Cup winning the tournament.[16]\nHowever, its performance in the UEFA Women's Euro 2017 was very disappointing: only one match won (against Portugal, the worst ranked team in Euro), two defeats against England (0–2) and Scotland (0–1) in the group stage. Nevertheless, Spain advanced to the quarterfinals, at which  point it lost against Austria in a match finishing 0–0 after extra time and then 3–5 in a penalty shoot-out. The national football team was therefore eliminated after more than 345 minutes without scoring a single goal."

    "content": "A civil war began on 15 April 2023 between two rival factions of the military government of Sudan. The conflict involves the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), led by General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), commanded by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (commonly known as Hemedti), who also leads the broader Janjaweed coalition.  Several smaller armed groups have also taken part. Fighting has been concentrated in the capital, Khartoum, where the conflict began with large-scale battles, and in the Darfur region.[47][48][49] Many civilians in Darfur have been reported dead as part of the Masalit massacres, which have been described as ethnic cleansing or genocide.[50] Sudan has been described as facing the world's worst humanitarian crisis; nearly 25 million people are experiencing extreme hunger.[51] On 7 January 2025, the United States said it had determined that the RSF and allied militias committed genocide.[52]"

    "content": "Since gaining independence in 1956, Sudan has endured chronic instability marked by 20 coup attempts, prolonged military rule, two devastating civil wars, and the Darfur genocide. The war erupted amid tensions over the integration of the RSF into the army following the 2021 coup, starting with RSF attacks on government sites in Khartoum and other cities. The capital region was soon divided between the two factions, and al-Burhan relocated his government to Port Sudan. International efforts, including the May 2023 Jeddah Declaration, failed to stop the fighting, while various rebel groups entered the war: the SPLM–North (al-Hilu faction) attacked the SAF in the south; the Tamazuj movement joined the RSF; and the SAF gained support from factions of the Sudan Liberation Movement and the Justice and Equality Movement. By late 2023, the RSF controlled most of Darfur and advanced in Khartoum, Kordofan, and Gezira. The SAF regained momentum in early 2024, making gains in Omdurman and eventually retaking Khartoum, including the Presidential Palace and airport, by March 2025. Despite renewed negotiations, no lasting ceasefire has been reached, and the war continues with severe humanitarian consequences and regional implications."

Regional support for the RSF comes from the UAE and Chad, while Egypt supports the SAF, amid regional tensions. The war has triggered a massive humanitarian crisis marked by extreme shortages of food, water, medicine, and aid access, widespread hospital closures, disease outbreaks, mass displacement, looting of humanitarian supplies, and the near-collapse of education and infrastructure, leaving over half the population in urgent need of assistance. There have been calls for more aid, legal protections for humanitarian workers, refugee support, and an end to arms supplies to the RSF, particularly by the UAE. Both the SAF and RSF have waged sophisticated disinformation campaigns using social media, fake footage, and AI-generated content to manipulate public perception, discredit opponents, and influence international opinion. In response to the conflict, the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, and the European Union imposed sanctions on individuals, companies, and entities linked to the SAF and RSF for ceasefire violations, human rights abuses, and destabilizing activities."

The resulting War in Darfur was marked by widespread state-sponsored acts of violence, leading to charges of war crimes and genocide against al-Bashir.[60] The initial phase of the conflict left approximately 300,000 dead and 2.7 million forcibly displaced; even though the intensity of the violence later declined, the situation in the region remained far from peaceful.[61]"

Al-Hilu held out until he agreed to sign a separate peace agreement with the Sudanese government a few months later.[84] Further steps to consolidate the agreement stalled following the 2021 coup, and the al-Hilu faction instead signed an agreement with the SLM-al-Nur and the Sudanese Communist Party, agreeing to co-operate to draft a 'revolutionary charter' and remove the military from power.[85]"

Hemedti saw the appointment of these officials as a signal that al-Burhan was attempting to maintain the dominance of Khartoum's traditional elite over Sudanese politics. This was a danger to the RSF's political position, as said elites were hostile to Hemedti due to his ethnic background as a Darfuri Arab.[87] Hemedti's expression of regret over the October 2021 coup signalled a widening divide between him and al-Burhan.[72]"

SPLM-N forces proceeded to attack the RSF, and the paramilitary retreated from the city.[221] RSF fighters withdrawing from Dalang entered the city of Muglad in West Kordofan, easily taking control as the city had no organised SAF presence. West Kordofan had been relatively free of fighting for several months due to a local truce brokered by leaders of the Messiria tribe, but as tensions escalated rumours spread that the RSF was planning an attack on the encircled city of Babanusa and the SAF 22nd Infantry Division garrisoning it.[221]"

The SAF has become increasingly dependent on Islamist networks, as these movements have mobilized many civilians from popular resistance brigades.

This has forced evacuations to be undertaken by road via Port Sudan on the Red Sea, which lies about 650 km (400 miles) northeast of Khartoum.[334] from where they were airlifted or ferried directly to their home countries or third ones. Other evacuations were undertaken through overland border crossings or airlifts from diplomatic missions and other designated locations with direct involvement of the militaries of some home countries.

This mirrored its approach in past conflicts, prioritizing stability to protect economic interests.[361] China's Sudan strategy ties into the Belt and Road Initiative, aiming to secure Red Sea trade routes and infrastructure links. The civil war delayed these ambitions, reinforcing China's preference for a stable, cooperative government in Khartoum. Unlike Russia, which has militarily backed the RSF, or the US, which pursues sanctions and mediation, China prioritizes economic continuity over ideological alignment.[362] On 9 January 2025 China donated emergency food aid (1,250 tonnes) to be allocated to all states.[363]"

    "content": "Since the outbreak of renewed violence in Sudan in 2023, South Sudan has adopted a mediatory role, urging peace and engaging with IGAD and the AU, though with limited success due to the conflict's complexity and multiple factions. South Sudan is deeply concerned about spillover effects—such as refugee flows and economic instability—and recognizes that its own fragile stability is tied to Sudan's fate.[407][408] Tensions escalated further with a February 2025 alliance between Sudan's RSF and the SPLM-N, a rebel group near the South Sudanese border. Experts warn this could pull South Sudan into the conflict, especially if the Sudanese army supports rival South Sudanese militias in response. With shared borders, historical ties, and existing political tensions between South Sudan's leaders (President Salva Kiir Mayardit and Vice President Riek Machar), the risk of both wars merging is high. The strategic location of the RSF-SPLM-N alliance also boosts smuggling and military operations, weakening Sudan's army and increasing regional instability. If unchecked, experts fear the two conflicts could become indistinguishable, worsening humanitarian crises in both countries.[409][410]"

This later reached SDG1250 in February 2024. The formal economy was described as being in a \"near standstill\".[505][503] Gold production was also reduced to just 2 tons from the previous year's output of 18 tons.[506] Sudanese minister for minerals Mohamed Bashir Abu Nammu accused the RSF of looting around 15 tons of silver and 1,273 kilograms of gold from the Sudan Gold Refinery at the start of the conflict.[507]"

    "content": "A guy-wire, guy-line, guy-rope, down guy, or stay, also called simply a guy, is a tensioned cable designed to add stability to a freestanding structure. They are used commonly for ship masts, radio masts, wind turbines, utility poles, and tents. A thin vertical mast supported by guy wires is called a guyed mast.  Structures that support antennas are frequently of a lattice construction and are called \"towers\".  One end of the guy is attached to the structure, and the other is anchored to the ground at some distance from the mast or tower base.  The tension in the diagonal guy-wire, combined with the compression and buckling strength of the structure, allows the structure to withstand lateral loads such as wind or the weight of cantilevered structures. They are installed radially, usually at equal angles about the structure, in trios and quads. As the tower leans a bit due to the wind force, the increased guy tension is resolved into a compression force in the tower or mast and a lateral force that resists the wind load. For example, antenna masts are often held up by three guy-wires at 120° angles. Structures with  predictable lateral loads, such as electrical utility poles, may require only a single guy-wire to offset the lateral pull of the electrical wires at a spot where the wires change direction.[1]"

    "content": "Electromagnetic fields from the antennas complicate the design of guys that support mast antennas. Conductive metal guy-wires whose lengths are near to quarter wavelength multiples of the transmitted frequency can distort the radiation pattern of the antenna. This also applies to guy wires of neighboring masts or nearby metal structures. To prevent this, each guy wire is divided by strain insulators into multiple sections, each segment non-resonant at the transmitted wavelength. Cylindrical or egg-shaped porcelain \"Johnny ball\" insulators (also called \"egg insulators\") are usually used. Non-conductive guys of Kevlar fiber (Phillystran) or extruded fiberglass rod are frequently used to not disturb the radiation pattern of the antennas. The strength and low stretch properties of Kevlar fiber approaches that of steel. However, Kevlar is very susceptible to ultraviolet degradation, so it is enclosed in a UV resistant plastic sheath."

The voltage caused by this static electricity can be several times larger than that generated by the transmitter. In order to avoid dangerous and unpredictable discharges, the insulators must be designed to withstand this high voltage, which  on tall masts results in over-dimensioned backstage insulators. At each backstage insulator, a lightning arrestor in the form of an arc gap is required for the purpose of over-voltage protection in case of lightning strikes. The insulators and arrestors must be maintained carefully, because an insulator failure can result in a mast collapse. Egg insulators have the porcelain in compression and if it fails, the end loops of the guy wires are still intertwined."

Following an amendment to the Olympic Charter in 1996, NOC recognition can only be granted after recognition as an independent country by the international community.[15] Since the rule does not apply retroactively, the dependent territories and constituent countries which were recognized before the rule change are allowed to continue sending separate teams to the Olympics,[15] while the Faroe Islands[16] and Macau[17] send their own Paralympic teams."

This rule also applies to territories experiencing a change in status – the Netherlands Antilles Olympic Committee was dissolved at the 123rd IOC session in July 2011 as the Netherlands Antilles ceased to exist in 2010.[21][22]"

At this point, the land portion of the Peninsula was relatively narrow between two creeks which drained into the James River and the York River. As much of the lower peninsula to the east was becoming settled, this was a natural point for the English settlers who established Jamestown and the Virginia Colony beginning in 1607 to build a line of defense during early conflicts with the Native Americans."

In an era of wooden buildings, brick was a sign of both wealth and permanence. Page built a large, brick house in Middle Plantation and began encouraging the growth of the area. The Ludwell brothers (Thomas and Phillip) also built a substantial brick home, even larger than that of Page.[3] The houses which Page and the Ludwells built were among the finest in the colony. The Pages' eldest son, Francis built another brick house nearby. By the third quarter of the seventeenth century, Middle Plantation began to look like a place of importance."

On August 3, at the house of Major Otho Thorpe at Middle Plantation, Nathaniel Bacon held a convention of the leading men, including four councillors. They adopted resolutions stressing independence from the people in power. The people pledged themselves to resist the Royal Governor, Sir William Berkeley to the utmost, and to oppose any force sent out from England. Historians note that it was a struggle for power between Bacon and his followers and the more established settlers represented by Berkeley. During the resulting conflict, Governor Berkeley retreated to the Eastern Shore. After Bacon died of natural causes later that year, Berkeley soon regained power and returned to the Peninsula."

Once reconciled, they had another son, Amalric, and Fulk no longer made any decision in the kingdom without Melisende's assent. During their joint rule, Melisende managed Church relations and patronage. Fulk died on 10 November 1143, and Melisende assumed full power. On 25 December, she was crowned together with their elder son, Baldwin III, who was still underage. Baldwin reached the age of majority in 1145, but Melisende refused to cede any authority to him. After the fall of Edessa in 1144, Melisende urged a military intervention from Europe, but likely opposed the Second Crusade's eventual focus–the failed attempt to conquer Damascus in 1148."

She continued to involve herself in the affairs of her family, who also ruled the crusader states of Antioch and Tripoli. Although her influence in Jerusalem became limited, she counseled Baldwin and took a successful military initiative in his absence. Her patronage and involvement in ecclesiastical matters also continued. In 1161 she became incapacitated by an illness, possibly a stroke, and died on 11 September."

During this journey the king of Jerusalem, Baldwin I, died. Baldwin II was elected to succeed him.[8] In 1119 the new king returned to Edessa to install his cousin Joscelin of Courtenay as the new count and to bring his wife and their daughters to Jerusalem.[9] Melisende's youngest sister, Ioveta, was born after her parents were crowned king and queen in 1119.[10]"

This militarized model of kingship made female rule particularly problematic, as it clashed with entrenched expectations of a warrior-king.[15]"

The delay may reflect her father's lingering hope of producing a son; until then, Melisende remained a potential successor, and the king likely hesitated to settle for a match unworthy of that status, just as appropriate suitors may have been wary of her uncertain future.[6] Queen Morphia died probably in 1126 or 1127. Because he no longer expected to have a son, King Baldwin started providing for his daughters and settling his succession.[11] Melisende, the eldest daughter, was to be his heir. Alice, the second eldest, was married to Prince Bohemond II of Antioch in 1126. Hodierna, the third daughter, may have already been betrothed to Raymond of Tripoli at this time. Ioveta, the youngest, was sent to the Convent of Saint Anne; the historian Hans E. Mayer believes that this was \"the safest way\" to ensure that her status as a porphyrogenita (born to crowned parents) would not threaten Melisende's claim.[20]"

Hodierna married the count of Tripoli, Raymond II, sometime before 1138. Barber believes that the union was arranged by Melisende in an attempt to link the ruling houses of all the crusader states. Ioveta, who had grown up in a convent, took vows as a nun around 1134.[59] According to William's chronicle, Melisende judged that Ioveta was of too high birth to be a mere nun and decided that she should be made an abbess instead.[52] Barber notes that \"there is no way of knowing\" whether Ioveta wished to live a monastic life or if Melisende induced her to negate the political threat which Ioveta may have represented as the sister born during their father's kingship.[59]"

The Convent of Saint Lazarus, as it came to be known, was in construction for six years. Melisende so generously endowed the convent with estates, golden and silver sacred vessels with precious stones, silks, and ecclesiastical robes that she made it richer than any other monastery or church in the kingdom.[65] Initially Melisende installed an elderly abbess. When the abbess died, Ioveta succeeded as Melisende intended, and Melisende sent further gifts, namely books, ornaments, and chalices.[56] In the construction and endowment of Bethany's convent Hamilton sees a \"spectacular\" example of Melisende's power of patronage.[52]"

She informed Fulk, who was at Bethgibelin, and let it be known that anyone who aided the bishop would have her deepest gratitude–an implicit threat. The king was not amenable to the Syriacs' plight, but agreed to delay judgement until the case was heard in the queen's presence. Thanks to Melisende's intercession, the Syriacs kept their land.[77] She worked to improve relations with the Armenian Church as well; its leader, the catholicos Gregory III, attended a synod of the Latin Church in Jerusalem in 1140. The Greek Orthodox Monastery of Saint Sabas also received an endowment from Melisende.[74] Her lavish gifts became legendary and earned her a reputation as a devoutly religious woman, but Mayer argues that she was primarily a shrewd politician and that through her donations she was buying the Church's political support.[78]"

The monk wrote that the queen did this to ensure that Alfonso Jordan, a relative of the counts of Tripoli, would not threaten the possession of Tripoli by her brother-in-law Raymond and sister Hodierna.[92] Melisende was on good terms with the Premonstratensians, however, and Barber attributes the monk's hostility to the \"endemic misogyny of the monastic world\".[91]"

Barber holds that Fulcher must have risen to the patriarchate with Melisende's support, yet he led the opposition to her choice of Ralph.[76] The conflict over the see of Tyre marked the only time Melisende was at odds with the Church.[78]"

In 1144 he quelled a revolt at Wadi Musa.[95] The queen and the constable faced the first crisis in her sole rule already in November when Zengi of Mosul besieged Edessa.[96] The Edessenes appealed to the young king for help, but it was Melisende who made the decisions.[95] She called a council, and it was decided that Manasses, Philip, and Elinand should lead a relief force.[97] Mayer believes that the young king was not sent because Melisende resented his success at Wadi Musa;[95] he argues that the queen did not wish to see her son gain a reputation as a military leader lest he become a threat to her political leadership.[98] Barber suggests that Melisende did not send Baldwin, then aged fourteen, because she thought that the gravity of the situation required experienced adults. In any case, the army did not reach Edessa in time:[97] the city fell to the Turks, who spared its Armenian and Greek population, but \"killed the Franks wherever they could\" according to the chronicler Michael the Syrian.[96] When word of Edessa's fall reached Jerusalem, Melisende sent to Antioch to consult with its leaders about dispatching an embassy to the pope to request a new crusade.[99] Baldwin III came of age on his fifteenth birthday in early 1145,[81] but the occasion was not publicly celebrated.[80]"

He came to Jerusalem and offered to deliver his towns to the Franks if they would establish him as lord in the Hauran. Melisende convened her council to consider the proposal. Though Damascus was their ally, the offer was appealing: the Hauran had a largely Christian population, and control of the region would place Damascus in a vulnerable position.[101] Unur's army prevented Altuntash from returning to either Bosra or Salkhad.[102] The Franks assembled an army at Tiberias, but also informed Unur that they intended to reinstall Altuntash. Unur objected, citing the queen's own feudal law against supporting rebellious vassals of friendly powers. He offered to repay her costs. Melisende sent a knight, Bernard Vacher, to inform Damascus that her army would escort Altuntash back to Bosra but would not attack Damascene territory. Bernard was persuaded by Unur that the expedition should be dropped. He convinced the young King Baldwin, and the council decided to abandon the plan. Agitators in the army, angered by the loss of a potentially profitable campaign, demanded that the expedition go forward. Baldwin gave in, only to be soundly defeated after Unur allied with Zengi's successor Nur al-Din.[103] Mayer is certain that Melisende blamed Baldwin for the failure to take the Hauran, saying that it may explain how Melisende was able to reduce Baldwin's position by associating her younger son, Amalric, in a subsequent charter.[104]"

This angered Barisan's sons, Hugh, Baldwin, and Balian, because it led to them losing land in Ramla.[84] Baldwin, for his part, held Manasses responsible for his estrangement from his mother.[117] Melisende further consolidated her position against Baldwin in 1151 when she made her younger son, Amalric, count of Jaffa.[118] He became her most important partisan besides the Church.[119] The same year, the queen ordered the demolition of a mill at Jerusalem's Jaffa Gate to ease traffic congestion, and in 1152 hired Arabs from al-Bireh to rebuild the market and stalls along the Street of Bad Cooking;[120][121] Mayer contends that she was courting the support of the citizenry in addition to the nobles and the clergy.[122]"

Upon hearing of her elder son's advance, Melisende withdrew with her household and followers to the Tower of David. Patriarch Fulcher at this point declared the Church's full support for the queen. He marched out with his clergy to admonish the king, only to return enraged after Baldwin rebuffed him.[126] The king set up camp outside the city, after which the citizens opened the gates to him.

Though she was apparently neither summoned nor invited, Melisende also participated.[129] Ostensibly she was there to help settle the marital problems of her sister Countess Hodierna and brother-in-law Count Raymond of Tripoli. Hamilton considers this a clever move because she could not be prevented from paying a visit to her sister, and once in Tripoli had to be invited to discuss her niece's marriage.[128] Neither goal was achieved.[129] The sisters set out for Jerusalem, and were escorted for a while by Hodierna's husband. As he was returning to Tripoli, he was killed by the Order of Assassins.[130] The sisters returned to Tripoli for the funeral, after which Baldwin escorted Melisende home.[131] Hodierna assumed rule over Tripoli as regent for her young son, Raymond III. Hamilton believes that from then on Baldwin's control over Antioch and Tripoli, ruled by Melisende's niece and sister respectively, depended on him treating his mother with respect.[132]"

Hamilton speculates that Melisende's forceful character made her sons reluctant to allow their wives to take part in state affairs.[138] In 1160 Queen Melisende joined Hodierna in commissioning luxurious jewelry, gold tiaras, and silver utensils for the dowry of Hodierna's daughter, Melisende of Tripoli; this example of Melisende's art patronage demonstrates the queen's continued activity and the Franks' resolve to impress her niece's betrothed, the Byzantine Emperor Manuel I Komnenos.[139]"

    "content": "Melisende appears in two works of historical fiction. In Emily Sarah Holt's Lady Sibyl's Choice (1879), Melisende predeceases Fulk and the fictional narrator laments her rights passing to Fulk's family. A strong-willed and independent Melisende, reflecting modern values of gender and equality, is a much more significant character in Judith Tarr's Queen of Swords (1997), though she is not the novel's central protagonist. The synopsis for Kate Mosse's forthcoming play The Queen of Jerusalem promises to celebrate \"the extraordinary woman who ruled Jerusalem in the 12th century\" and reflects a broader trend of portraying Melisende as a forgotten figure to be reclaimed. Park argues that Melisende’s appeal comes from her portrayal within a proto-feminist narrative that links her success in a male-dominated world to a universal female experience.[156]"

She described living through the Barrow Blitz as a small child, and becoming claustrophobic into adulthood, needing an exit route from any situation.[4] She was educated at Croslands Convent School[5] after spending some time in Wallasey. When her father found another job in Ilkeston, Derbyshire, the family moved to the Midlands, where Stella attended Nottingham High School for Girls. She spent her last summer of secondary school working as an au pair in Paris, before enrolling at the University of Edinburgh in 1954 to study English. By chance, she met her future husband, John Rimington, whom she had known from Nottingham.[6]\nCompleting her degree in 1958, she studied archive administration at the University of Liverpool, before beginning work as an archivist at the County Record Office in Worcester in 1959. In 1963, she married John Rimington and moved to London, where she successfully applied for a position at the India Office Library.[7]"

It was by Rohard's advice that the king attempted to push his wife, Queen Melisende, out of government.[2] The queen grew wrathful after Hugh, her cousin and ally, was stabbed and exiled.[4] The men who had supported Fulk against Hugh did not dare appear in her presence and thought it best to avoid public functions altogether. The queen reserved her greatest anger for Rohard, whom she believed had played the leading role in the conflict, and pursued him with a relentless hostility. It took Fulk a great effort to obtain Melisende's pardon for Rohard, which allowed him to at least attend court again.[5][2] In 1142 Rohard, Bishop Anselm of Bethlehem and Abbot Geoffrey of the Temple of the Lord were sent by Fulk on a sensitive mission to convince Emperor John II Komnenos not to come to Jerusalem on an armed pilgrimage.[6]"

She and Rohard were content to make peace, and he became part of her inner circle of supporters alongside the lord of Nablus, Philip of Milly, and the prince of Galilee, Elinand of Tiberias.[8] The three men, later joined by her younger son, Amalric, remained loyal to the queen throughout her struggle for power against her elder son, King Baldwin III. When in April 1152 Baldwin marched on Jerusalem, the queen and her loyal followers shut themselves in the citadel of the Tower of David. Although they defended themselves valiantly against Baldwin's bombardment, they could not resist indefinitely, and Melisende yielded the throne to Baldwin.[9] Rohard accompanied the deposed queen to Nablus, where she retired. Only in 1160 does he appear among the attendants of King Baldwin in Jerusalem.[10]"

The intent was to add the water removed by distillation back to the brandy shortly before consumption. It was discovered that after being stored in wooden casks, the resulting product improved over the original distilled spirit.[1] In addition to removing water, the distillation process led to the formation and decomposition of numerous aromatic compounds, fundamentally altering the distillate composition from its source. Non-volatile substances such as pigments, sugars, and salts remained behind in the still. As a result, the distillate taste was often quite unlike the sources."

In 1877,[9] the Ararat brandy brand[10] was established in Yerevan, Armenia. It became one of the top brandy brands over time and during the Yalta Conference, Winston Churchill was so impressed with the Armenian brandy Dvin given to him by Joseph Stalin[11] that he asked for several cases of it to be sent to him each year.[12][13] Reportedly 400 bottles of Dvin were shipped to Churchill annually.[14] In 1884, David Sarajishvili founded a brandy factory in Tbilisi, Georgia, a crossroads for Turkish, Central Asian, and Persian trade routes and a part of the Russian Empire at the time.[15]"

The first part, the \"head\", has an alcohol concentration of about 83% (166 US proof) and an unpleasant odour.

    "content": "Brandy is usually produced in pot stills (batch distillation), but the column still can also be used for continuous distillation. The distillate obtained in this manner has a higher alcohol concentration (approximately 90% ABV) and is less aromatic. The choice of the apparatus depends on the style of brandy produced.[16] Cognac and South African brandy are examples of brandy produced in batches[16] while many American brandies use fractional distillation in column stills.[citation needed]"

Some brandies, particularly those from Spain, are aged using the solera system, where the producer changes the barrel each year. After a period of ageing, which depends on the style, class and legal requirements, the mature brandy is mixed with distilled water to reduce alcohol concentration and bottled. Some brandies have caramel colour and sugar added to simulate the appearance of barrel ageing.[16]"

The Picardy terrain provided a good surface for tanks, unlike in Flanders, and the defences of the German 2nd Army under General Georg von der Marwitz were relatively weak, having been subjected to continual raiding by the Australians in a process termed peaceful penetration."

The Triple Entente was made up of the United Kingdom, France, and Russia. The Triple Alliance was originally composed of Germany, Austria–Hungary, and Italy, but Italy remained neutral in 1914. As the war progressed, each coalition added new members. Japan joined the Entente in 1914 and, despite proclaiming its neutrality at the beginning of the war, Italy also joined the Entente in 1915. The term \"Allies\" became more widely used than \"Entente\",[citation needed] although the United Kingdom, France, Russia, and Italy were also referred to as the Quadruple Entente and, together with Japan, as the Quintuple Entente.[1][2] The five British Dominions (Australia, Canada, New Zealand, Newfoundland, and the Union of South Africa) all fought alongside the British.  The colonies of Allied countries, such as the American Philippines, Belgian Congo, British India, French Algeria, and Japanese Korea, were also used as a source of manpower by the colonial powers."

But it eventually proved useless, the soldiers from Metropolitan France still undertook all the tasks.[46] From August to December 1914, the French lost nearly 300,000 dead on the Western Front, more than Britain suffered in the whole of WWII and the gaps were partly filled by colonial troops, over 500,000 of whom served on the Western Front over the period 1914–1918.[47] Colonial troops also fought at Gallipoli, occupied Togo and Kamerun in West Africa and had a minor role in the Middle East, where France was the traditional protector of Christians in the Ottoman provinces of Syria, Palestine and Lebanon.[48]"

This meant Japan could rely on British support in a war with Russia, if either France or Germany, which also had interests in China, decided to join them.[49] This gave Japan the reassurance needed to take on Russia in the 1905 Russo-Japanese War; victory established Japan in the Chinese province of Manchuria."

Up to 334 German 53 mm Fahrpanzer guns, 93 French 57 mm Hotchkiss guns, 66 Krupp 150 mm guns, and dozens more 210 mm guns were mounted on Romanian-built carriages and transformed into mobile field artillery, with 45 Krupp 75 mm guns and 132 Hotchkiss 57 mm guns being transformed into anti-aircraft artillery. The Romanians also upgraded 120 German Krupp 105 mm howitzers, the result being the most effective field howitzer in Europe at that time. Romania even managed to design and build from scratch its own model of mortar, the 250 mm Negrei Model 1916.[80]"

They were a class of four river monitors, built locally at the Galați shipyard using parts manufactured in Austria-Hungary. The first one launched was Lascăr Catargiu, in 1907.[82][83] The Romanian monitors displaced almost 700 tons, were armed with three 120 mm naval guns in three turrets, two 120 mm naval howitzers, four 47 mm anti-aircraft guns and two 6.5 machine guns.[84] The monitors took part in the Battle of Turtucaia and the First Battle of Cobadin. The Romanian-designed Schneider 150 mm Model 1912 howitzer was considered one of the most modern field guns on the Western Front.[85]"

    "content": "Romania's entry into the War in August 1916 provoked major changes for the Germans. General Erich von Falkenhayn was dismissed and sent to command the Central Powers forces in Romania, which enabled Hindenburg's subsequent ascension to power.[9] Due to having to fight against all of the Central Powers on the longest front in Europe (1,600 km) and with little foreign help (only 50,000 Russians aided 650,000 Romanians in 1916),[86] the Romanian capital was conquered that December. Vlaicu III was also captured and shipped to Germany, being last seen in 1942.[87] The Romanian administration established a new capital at Iași and continued to fight on the Allied side in 1917.[88] Despite being relatively short, the Romanian campaign of 1916 provided considerable respite for the Western Allies, as the Germans ceased all their other offensive operations in order to deal with Romania.[89] After suffering a tactical defeat against the Romanians (aided by Russians) in July 1917 at Mărăști, the Central Powers launched two counterattacks, at Mărășești and Oituz. The German offensive at Mărășești was soundly defeated, with German prisoners later telling their Romanian captors that German casualties were extremely heavy, and that they \"had not encountered such stiff resistance since the battles of Somme and Verdun\".[90] The Austro-Hungarian offensive at Oituz also failed. On 22 September, the Austro-Hungarian Enns-class river monitor SMS Inn was sunk by a Romanian mine near Brăila.[91][92] After Russia signed the Treaty of Brest-Litovsk and dropped out of the War, Romania was left surrounded by the Central Powers and eventually signed a similar treaty on 7 May 1918. Despite being forced to cede land to Austria-Hungary and Bulgaria, Romania ended up with a net gain in territory due to the Union with Bessarabia. On 10 November, Romania re-entered the War and fought a war with Hungary that lasted until August 1919."

The First Brazilian Republic sent the Naval Division in War Operations that joined the British fleet in Gibraltar and made the first Brazilian naval effort in international waters. In compliance with the commitments made at the Inter-American Conference, held in Paris from 20 November to 3 December 1917, the Brazilian Government sent a medical mission composed of civilian and military surgeons to work in field hospitals of the European theatre, a contingent of sergeants and officers to serve with the French Army; Airmen from the Army and Navy to join the Royal Air Force, and the employment of part of the Fleet, primarily in the anti-submarine war."

The US entered the war as an \"associated power\", rather than a formal ally of France and the United Kingdom, in order to avoid \"foreign entanglements\".[94] Although the Ottoman Empire and Bulgaria severed relations with the United States, neither declared war,[95] nor did Austria-Hungary. Eventually, however, the United States also declared war on Austria-Hungary in December 1917, predominantly to help hard-pressed Italy."
